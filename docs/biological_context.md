# Biological Research: DRP1 Loss-of-Function Mutations, Synaptic Ribosome Dysfunction, and Neurodevelopmental Epilepsy in Cortical Neurons

## Summary of Key Findings

DRP1 (DNM1L) loss-of-function mutations cause severe neurodevelopmental epileptic encephalopathy through disruption of mitochondrial fission, leading to impaired synaptic energy metabolism and downregulation of local protein synthesis machinery at presynaptic and postsynaptic compartments. The maturation-specific effects (D35→D65) in hiPSC-derived cortical neurons reveal that **synaptic ribosome downregulation** creates an energy-translation crisis during the critical period of synaptogenesis, resulting in aberrant calcium handling, failed synaptic maturation, and neuronal hyperexcitability that manifests as refractory seizures.

## Clinical Context: DNM1L Mutations and Pediatric Epileptic Encephalopathy

### Disease Presentation

De novo heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in DNM1L present in the first year of life with devastating neurodevelopmental phenotypes including severe epileptic encephalopathy, developmental delay, optic atrophy, and refractory seizures [Vanstone et al., 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5100740/). The most common clinical features include global developmental delay (12/13 cases), refractory seizures and status epilepticus (8/13), hypotonia, and respiratory distress [Vanstone et al., 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5100740/). Previously reported patients with de novo missense mutations presented with severe encephalopathy and refractory epilepsy, with most patients not surviving past childhood or early adolescence [Vanstone et al., 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5100740/).

### Mutation Mechanisms: G32A and R403C

**Both G32A (GTPase domain) and R403C (stalk domain) act as dominant-negative mutations** that disrupt DRP1 oligomerization and recruitment to mitochondria [Vanstone et al., 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5100740/). When mCherry-tagged DRP1-G32A and DRP1-R403C were overexpressed in wild-type fibroblasts, these mutations caused mitochondrial hyperfusion in a dominant-negative manner [Vanstone et al., 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5100740/). Both patient fibroblast lines showed increased mitochondrial volume, surface area, and major axis length consistent with hyperfused mitochondrial morphology, with G32A showing slightly more severe elongation than R403C [Vanstone et al., 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5100740/).

### Synaptic Maturation Defects in Patient Neurons

In hiPSC-derived cortical neurons harboring these mutations, mutant DRP1 neurons maintained highly elongated mitochondria within their axons throughout maturation (D35-D65), with significant mutation-specific changes to mitochondrial motility [Khanal et al., 2024](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11370610/). **Transcriptional profiling of mutant DRP1 cortical neurons during maturation revealed mutation-dependent alterations in synaptic development and calcium regulation gene expression** [Khanal et al., 2024](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11370610/). Deficits in pre- and post-synaptic marker colocalization using super-resolution microscopy strongly suggest that altered mitochondrial morphology leads to pathogenic dysregulation of synaptic development and activity [Khanal et al., 2024](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11370610/).

## Mechanistic Questions

1. **What is the transcriptional regulatory mechanism causing ribosome gene downregulation?**
   - Examine expression of transcription factors regulating ribosomal RNA synthesis (e.g., MYC, mTOR targets)
   - Check for ribosome stress response activation (ZNF622, ATF4, p53)

2. **Is ribosome downregulation a cell-autonomous response to energy deficit, or a programmed developmental arrest?**
   - Compare ribosome expression in energy-depleted neurons (e.g., OXPHOS inhibitor treatment) vs DRP1 mutants
   - Test whether ATP supplementation or enhancing mitochondrial biogenesis rescues ribosome expression

3. **Why are BOTH presynaptic and postsynaptic ribosomes affected?**
   - Could reflect common energy dependence (both require local ATP)
   - Or could indicate trans-synaptic signaling (e.g., failed postsynaptic maturation signals back to presynaptic terminal)

4. **Is there a therapeutic window during the critical period (D35-D65)?**
   - Early intervention to enhance mitochondrial function or protein synthesis may prevent synaptic maturation failure
   - Late intervention after D65 may face consolidated network dysfunction

5. **Which comes first: calcium dysregulation or ribosome downregulation?**
   - NNAT is massively upregulated at D35 (early calcium defect)
   - Ribosome pathways show maturation-specific effects (D35→D65)
   - Suggests calcium defects may precede/cause translation defects

## Molecular Mechanisms: Mitochondrial Fission, Synaptic Positioning, and Energy Supply

### DRP1 Function in Neuronal Mitochondrial Dynamics

DRP1 is recruited to the mitochondrial outer membrane by receptors including Fis1, MFF, MiD49, and MiD51, where it oligomerizes to mediate mitochondrial fission [Breckenridge et al., 2020](https://portlandpress.com/neuronalsignal/article/4/2/NS20200008/224381/Mechanisms-and-roles-of-mitochondrial-localisation). **Mitochondrial fission is required for the proper distribution of mitochondria in dendrites and axons**, as Drp1 deficiency results in depletion of mitochondria from developing neurites, reduced neurite outgrowth, impaired synapse formation, and neurodegeneration [Ishihara et al., 2009](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5394918/). Neurons require appropriate distribution of mitochondria to provide energy for neuronal activities such as synaptic transmission, axonal and dendritic transport, and synaptic vesicle recycling [Breckenridge et al., 2020](https://portlandpress.com/neuronalsignal/article/4/2/NS20200008/224381/Mechanisms-and-roles-of-mitochondrial-localisation).

### Synaptic Mitochondria as Energy Hubs

**Mitochondria accumulate at synaptic regions where they provide proper energy supply for synaptic signaling** [Breckenridge et al., 2020](https://portlandpress.com/neuronalsignal/article/4/2/NS20200008/224381/Mechanisms-and-roles-of-mitochondrial-localisation). The large size of many neurons precludes rapid diffusion of ATP from one end of the cell to the other, implying that energy production must be spatially matched to local energy usage, requiring mitochondria to be located close to sites of ion influxes that generate synaptic and action potentials [Rangaraju et al., 2019](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/39/42/8200). Mitochondria localization close to synapses regulates signaling at neuronal and immune synapses [Quintana et al., 2011](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3094123/).

### Spatial Compartmentalization of ATP for Translation

**Critical Discovery: Spatially stable dendritic mitochondrial compartments fuel local translation during synaptic plasticity within spatially confined boundaries** [Rangaraju et al., 2019](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092867418316271). These dendritic mitochondria exist as stable compartments of single or multiple filaments that are surprisingly stable, anchored via the cytoskeleton, and can remain in place for over an hour [Rangaraju et al., 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-44233-8). **Depletion of local mitochondrial compartments abolished both plasticity and stimulus-induced synaptic translation**, demonstrating that local ATP production is essential for synaptic protein synthesis [Rangaraju et al., 2019](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092867418316271).

While global ATP levels are adequate for basal translation, **mitochondrial compartments anchored nearby are required to power local translation for the enhanced energy demands associated with synaptic plasticity** [Lee et al., 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8317219/). Dendritic mitochondria provide ATP for actin dynamics, supporting growth of the postsynaptic density, surface expression of neurotransmitter receptors, and local translation [Lee et al., 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8317219/).

## Local Protein Synthesis at Synapses: Ribosome Localization and Function

### Ubiquitous Synaptic Ribosome Presence

**Landmark Finding: Over 75% of both excitatory and inhibitory presynaptic terminals in the hippocampus and forebrain contain mRNA and ribosomes**, including rRNA, ribosomes, and polyadenylated mRNA [Hafner et al., 2019](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.aau3644). After brief metabolic labeling, more than 30% of all presynaptic terminals exhibited active translation, with approximately 40% of both excitatory and inhibitory presynaptic terminals and about 60% of dendritic spines showing active translation [Hafner et al., 2019](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.aau3644).

In mammalian CNS neurons, electron microscopy has visualized polyribosomes present in dendritic shafts as well as at the base and interior of dendritic spines [Steward & Schuman, 2001](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.97.21.11545). Translationally competent ribosomes are found in presynaptic nerve terminals, where they can be active under resting conditions [Hafner et al., 2019](https://elifesciences.org/articles/36697).

### Energy Requirements for Protein Synthesis

**Peptide bond formation at the ribosome consumes 4 ATP equivalents per peptide bond formed**: two ATP molecules for amino acid activation and another two ATP equivalents for peptide bond formation and ribosome translation [Lynch & Marinov, 2015](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2632092/). Most cellular ATP is utilized in protein synthesis via tRNA aminoacylation and GTP regeneration [Lynch & Marinov, 2015](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2632092/). **Neuronal activity-induced protein synthesis is responsible for significant ATP expenditure**, and perturbing mitochondrial function that colocalizes with translational hotspots at neurite branch points impairs branch-point protein synthesis and branch stabilization [Spillane et al., 2013](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/molecular-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2022.823135/full).

### Presynaptic Protein Synthesis and Neurotransmitter Release

Neurotransmitter release from presynaptic terminals is sustained by constant local recycling of synaptic vesicles independent from the neuronal cell body [Shupliakov & Brodin, 2010](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4194108/). The synaptic vesicle cycle—including exocytosis, endocytosis, refilling with neurotransmitter, and re-docking at the active zone—ensures high fidelity of synaptic transmission and maintains synaptic efficacy [Alabi & Tsien, 2012](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/39/42/8209). **Key events during the synaptic vesicle cycle require formation and disassembly of protein complexes, posing unique challenges for proteostasis at synaptic terminals** [Shupliakov & Brodin, 2010](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4194108/).

Presynaptic ribosomes, tethered to Rab7a-containing endosomal vesicles, drive the translation of mRNAs relevant to mitochondrial functions [Cioni et al., 2019](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.aau3644). This co-localization suggests coordinated regulation of energy metabolism and local protein synthesis at presynaptic sites.

### Postsynaptic Protein Synthesis and Receptor Trafficking

**Long-term potentiation (LTP) involves the insertion of additional AMPA receptors into the postsynaptic membrane by a combination of exocytosis and lateral diffusion** [Henley & Wilkinson, 2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3622464/). Glutamate receptor mRNAs (including NMDAR1, GABA-A receptors, and Ca2+ channels) can be translated in isolated dendrites, and dendritic protein synthesis is required for long-term changes in synaptic efficacy [Steward & Schuman, 2001](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.97.21.11545).

**Spine enlargement occurs concurrently with AMPAR recruitment, leading to correlated spine size and synaptic transmission** [Henley & Wilkinson, 2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3622464/). The late phase of LTP, which lasts days or even weeks, requires gene transcription and new protein synthesis, while the induction phase occurs without synthesis of new proteins, relying on post-translational modifications [Henley & Wilkinson, 2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3622464/).

### mRNA Targeting and Ribosome Localization

mRNAs can be targeted to specific neuronal subcellular domains, and local mRNA translation occurs at specific subcellular locations within neurons [Cioni et al., 2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7536069/). **Omic studies have revealed that over 1000 mRNAs are present and can be selectively locally translated in presynaptic and postsynaptic compartments from development to adulthood in vivo** [Sutton & Schuman, 2006](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8161363/). At both embryonic and adult stages, axons are enriched for mRNAs encoding ribosomal and mitochondrial proteins [Cioni et al., 2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7536069/).

## Critical Period Synaptogenesis and Maturation (D35→D65)

### Developmental Timeline in hiPSC-Derived Cortical Neurons

**The D35-D65 period represents a critical window for synaptogenesis and functional maturation in iPSC-derived cortical neurons** [Puppala et al., 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/mp201756). Neurons derived from iPSCs showed increased densities of presynaptic (SYN1) and postsynaptic (PSD95) markers at day 65, with colocalization of SHANK and the excitatory marker PSD95 first detectable at 30 days after neural stem cell differentiation [Puppala et al., 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/mp201756).

Most groups of genes involved in postsynaptic processes become enriched in human-induced neurons at day 35, indicating this is a critical maturation milestone [Marchetto et al., 2019](https://elifesciences.org/articles/59323). Cultures at day 56 expressed various layer-specific cortical markers including BRN2, TBR1, FOXP2, CUX1, and mature dendritic marker MAP2 [Puppala et al., 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/mp201756).

### Critical Period Plasticity Mechanisms

During critical periods, cortical networks undergo many iterations of synaptogenesis, maturation, and pruning, becoming increasingly organized with selectively strengthened, stable connections [Hensch, 2020](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1820836117). **Experience-dependent regulation of synaptic strength establishes circuit functions that are stabilized as critical period plasticity wanes** [Hensch, 2020](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1820836117).

While synaptogenesis starts prenatally, the increase in synapse numbers continues postnatally, with spine formation prominent in juvenile rodents during the critical period for ocular dominance plasticity [Hensch & Fagiolini, 2005](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn1787). **Rapid ocular dominance plasticity requires cortical but not geniculate protein synthesis**, demonstrating the necessity of local translation during critical period plasticity [Taha & Stryker, 2002](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2553093/).

### Protein Synthesis Requirements During Critical Periods

BDNF's normal role includes stimulating energy metabolism by increasing glucose use/transport and enhancing protein synthesis [Taha & Stryker, 2002](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2553093/). PKA can rapidly modulate synaptic efficacy and initiate protein synthesis-dependent growth processes [Taha & Stryker, 2002](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2553093/). The cooperative yet opposing function of two postsynaptic signaling scaffolds, PSD-93 and PSD-95, governs the maturation of gestalt synapses [Frank et al., 2024](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-024-01728-x).

## Activity-Dependent Translation and Calcium Signaling

### CaMKII-mTOR Pathway Coupling Translation to Activity

**CaMKII (calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II) is an abundant neuronal protein involved in synaptic plasticity and learning**, and LTP induction results in calcium entry, which activates CaMKII that subsequently translocates to the synapse where it binds to NMDA receptors and produces potentiation by phosphorylating AMPA receptor subunits [Yasuda, 2022](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36056211/).

**Spaced stimulation rapidly increases presynaptic CaMKII through local translation of pre-existing mRNA, independently of somatic factors** [Rangaraju et al., 2024](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.11.03.686364v1). mRNA translation happens in synaptic locations including dendrites and dendritic spines, which contain polyribosomes, translation factors, and mRNAs [Yasuda, 2022](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36056211/).

**Activity-dependent synthesis requires CaMKII T287 autophosphorylation-induced activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway** [Rangaraju et al., 2024](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.11.03.686364v1). mTORC1 promotes mRNA translation initiation in the CNS, and excitatory neurons, inhibitory neurons, and glia play distinct roles in modulating synaptic strength and encoding long-term memory via mTORC1 signaling [Huang et al., 2025](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jnc.70281).

### ER-Mitochondria Contact Sites and Calcium Regulation

**Mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs) are lipid raft-like regions where the ER physically contacts mitochondria, playing important roles in lipid synthesis, calcium homeostasis, and apoptotic signaling** [Area-Gomez & Schon, 2016](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1300677110). The molecular chaperone glucose-regulated protein 75 (Grp75) facilitates this interaction by forming an ER-mitochondrial tethering complex within the MAM, crucial for bidirectional calcium transfer between these organelles [Area-Gomez & Schon, 2016](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1300677110).

**In neurons, the interaction between ER and mitochondria in synapses has been postulated to shape intracellular Ca2+ signals and modulate synaptic and integrative neuronal activities** [Smith et al., 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41540-021-00185-7). The organization of these organelles and inter-organellar contact sites play a key role in modulating Ca2+ and ATP dynamics [Smith et al., 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41540-021-00185-7).

### STIM-ORAI Store-Operated Calcium Entry

**Store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) is mediated by stromal interaction molecule (STIM) in the ER membrane and calcium release-activated calcium modulator 1 (ORAI) on the plasma membrane** [Yuan et al., 2009](https://biosignaling.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12964-024-02014-w). Upon depletion of calcium stores, STIM undergoes conformational changes, assembles into oligomers, activates ORAI, and promotes influx of extracellular calcium [Yuan et al., 2009](https://biosignaling.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12964-024-02014-w).

**STIM proteins actively modulate neurotransmission by inhibiting both voltage-gated calcium channels and NMDA receptors**, and they regulate AMPA receptor trafficking and can increase the number and stability of mushroom spines via a CaMKII and EB3/microtubules-dependent pathway [Popugaeva & Bezprozvanny, 2013](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2012.00061/full).

### IP3R and RyR Calcium Release Channels

**The inositol trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) and ryanodine receptor (RyR) are ER-resident Ca2+ channels that mediate the generation of ER-generated Ca2+ signals** [Foskett et al., 2021](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00033.2020). Rodent hippocampal neurons chiefly express the IP3R1 and RyR2 isoforms, though RyR1 is found exclusively in Purkinje cells in the cerebellum [Wojcikiewicz, 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/inositol-trisphosphate-receptor).

**Ca2+ release contributes to neuronal excitability and neurotransmitter release by increasing cytosolic Ca2+, influencing synaptic vesicle exocytosis and neurotransmission** [Ruiz et al., 2009](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0050066). Calcium release mediated by neuronal IP3R1 or RyR2 channels made significant contributions to activity-induced nuclear and mitochondrial Ca2+ signal generation [Bootman et al., 2025](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006291X25001597).

## Specific Gene Functions in Calcium Handling and Neuronal Excitability

### NNAT (Neuronatin): ER Calcium Store Regulation

**NNAT is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mediates neural induction through an increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+ level by inhibiting SERCA2** (sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase isoform 2) [Lin et al., 2010](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3003906/). Neuronatin is predominantly expressed in the developing brain and thought to play an important role in brain development, and is required for efficient induction of neural lineage in embryonic stem cells [Lin et al., 2010](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3003906/).

**NNAT initiates neural induction in embryonic stem cells through increasing intracellular Ca2+ by antagonizing SERCA2 in the ER, which increases phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and inhibits the BMP4 pathway** [Lin et al., 2010](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3003906/). Overexpression of NNAT recapitulates spine loss and ER calcium overload in cortical neurons with PSEN1 mutation [Munguba et al., 2022](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9012292/).

**In the DRP1 mutation context, NNAT was the first and third most significantly differentially expressed gene in both R403C and G32A mutants at D35** [Khanal et al., 2024](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11370610/), suggesting profound dysregulation of ER calcium handling during the critical period of synaptogenesis.

### CACNG3: AMPA Receptor Modulation and Excitability

**The calcium channel γ subunit CACNG3 is a modulator of AMPA receptors at postsynaptic membranes**, and their function in trafficking of AMPA receptors is more clear than their association with calcium channel complexes [Burgess et al., 2001](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4691803/). Mutations in the γ2 subunit protein (stargazin) have been found in stargazer and waggler mouse epilepsy models, and some or all of the phenotype associated with mutations in these mice could involve AMPA-mediated signaling [Burgess et al., 2001](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4691803/).

**Fast synaptic excitation within brain regions relevant to epilepsy is mediated predominantly by AMPA receptors, and AMPA receptor antagonists markedly reduce or abolish epileptiform activity in experimental models** [Rogawski, 2011](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4506648/).

**In DRP1 mutant neurons, CACNG3 showed >2-fold decrease at D65 in both mutants**, and mutants displayed significantly higher mean amplitude of calcium fluorescence after glutamate stimulation, with faster time-to-peak calcium response [Khanal et al., 2024](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11370610/). The area under the curve was significantly higher in G32A cultures, indicating slower calcium clearance [Khanal et al., 2024](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11370610/).

### RYR1 and ATP2A1: Muscle-Type Calcium Handling in Neurons

While RYR1 (ryanodine receptor 1) is found exclusively in Purkinje cells in the cerebellum under normal conditions [Wojcikiewicz, 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/inositol-trisphosphate-receptor), its abnormal expression in cortical neurons may indicate aberrant developmental programming or inappropriate muscle-like excitation-contraction coupling mechanisms. Similarly, ATP2A1 (SERCA1) is predominantly a fast-twitch skeletal muscle isoform of the ER calcium pump.

The presence of these muscle-type calcium handling genes in the RNA-seq dataset from cortical neurons suggests potential developmental dysregulation or compensatory mechanisms in response to ER stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in DRP1 mutant neurons.

### STIM1, STIM2, and ORAI1: Store-Operated Calcium Entry

As described above, the STIM-ORAI system mediates store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) in neurons and plays critical roles in maintaining ER calcium stores, regulating synaptic plasticity, and modulating neuronal excitability [Popugaeva & Bezprozvanny, 2013](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2012.00061/full). Dysregulation of these genes in DRP1 mutants could reflect compensatory responses to ER calcium depletion or altered MAM function.

## Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Energy Crisis, and Epilepsy

### Mechanisms Linking Mitochondrial Dysfunction to Seizures

**Mitochondria are the main producers of ATP needed for normal electrical activities of neurons and synaptic transmission** [Kann & Kovács, 2007](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1567724911001851). Additionally, they have a central role in neurotransmitter synthesis, calcium homeostasis, redox signaling, production and modulation of reactive oxygen species, and neuronal death [Kann & Kovács, 2007](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1567724911001851).

**Hypotheses link mitochondrial failure to seizure generation through: (1) changes in calcium homeostasis, (2) oxidation of ion channels and neurotransmitter transporters by reactive oxygen species, (3) decrease in neuronal plasma membrane potential, and (4) reduced network inhibition due to interneuronal dysfunction** [Rahman, 2015](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(15)00148-9/abstract).

**As neurons are terminally differentiated cells that lack significant regenerative capacity and have high energy demand, they are more vulnerable to mitochondrial dysfunction** [Zsurka & Kunz, 2015](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9656379/). Seizures, irrespective of their origin, represent excessive acute energy demand in the brain, and secondary mitochondrial dysfunction has been described in various epileptic disorders [Rahman, 2015](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(15)00148-9/abstract).

### Energy-Translation Crisis Model

**Key Mechanistic Integration**: Defective mitochondrial metabolism leads to excessive cell excitation through diverse mechanisms: (1) lowering of GABA-mediated inhibition from death of inhibitory interneurons, (2) suppression of hippocampal intermediate inhibitory neurons activity, and (3) increasing glutamate release in the synaptic space by astrocytes [Zsurka & Kunz, 2015](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9656379/).

**In the context of DRP1 mutations and ribosome downregulation, the energy-translation crisis operates at multiple levels:**

1. **Impaired mitochondrial positioning** → Failure to deliver ATP to synaptic translation sites
2. **Local ATP depletion** → Insufficient energy for ribosome function (4 ATP per peptide bond)
3. **Reduced protein synthesis** → Failure to produce/maintain synaptic proteins (receptors, channels, vesicle machinery)
4. **Aberrant calcium handling** → Hyperexcitability due to dysregulated NNAT, CACNG3, STIM/ORAI
5. **Failed synaptic maturation** → Aberrant network formation during critical period (D35-D65)
6. **Network hyperexcitability** → Seizures

## Ribosomopathies and Neurodevelopmental Epilepsy

### Ribosome Dysfunction as a Cause of Epilepsy

**Ribosomopathies are characterized by syndromic disorders with microcephaly, growth retardation, and seizures** [Brooks et al., 2014](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25316788/). A novel missense mutation in RPL10 (encoding 60S ribosomal protein L10) has been identified in an X-linked ribosomopathy with syndromic intellectual disability and epilepsy [Brooks et al., 2014](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25316788/).

**Mutations in EEF1A2, a muscle- and neuron-specific translation factor, cause severe drug-resistant epilepsy, autism, and neurodevelopmental delay** [Nakajima et al., 2023](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2307704120). These mutations cause decreased protein synthesis via reduced translation elongation, increased tRNA binding, and decreased actin-bundling activity [Nakajima et al., 2023](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2307704120). In mouse cortical neurons, EEF1A2 mutations decrease de novo protein synthesis and alter neuronal morphology, acting via a toxic gain of function [Nakajima et al., 2023](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2307704120).

### Ribosome Biogenesis and Neuronal Development

**Alterations in the Eukaryotic Initiation Factor 4A2 (EIF4A2) gene have been identified as the cause of a novel developmental epileptic encephalopathy syndrome**, with EIF4A2 belonging to the DEAD-box family of proteins, many of which regulate protein translation [Jackson et al., 2022](https://www.texaschildrens.org/content/research/new-neurodevelopmental-epilepsy-disorder-and-its-genetic-cause-discovered).

**Many neurodevelopmental defects are linked to genes encoding ribosome biogenesis factors** [Bhaduri et al., 2025](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-025-01708-8). **Ribosome levels decrease during neuroepithelial differentiation, making cells vulnerable to perturbations in ribosome biogenesis, which disrupts survival and cell fate commitment** [Bhaduri et al., 2025](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-025-01708-8).

## GABA/Glutamate Imbalance and Protein Synthesis Requirements

### Excitatory-Inhibitory Balance

**An imbalance between excitation and inhibition has been a longstanding proposed mechanism regarding seizure generation and epileptogenesis**, related to increased extracellular glutamate and/or reduction in GABA concentrations, leading to excitotoxicity, seizures, and cell death [Purnell et al., 2021](https://www.seizure-journal.com/article/S1059-1311(21)00216-8/fulltext).

**GABA, the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter in the cerebral cortex, maintains the inhibitory tone that counterbalances neuronal excitation; when this balance is perturbed, seizures may ensue** [Treiman, 2001](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11520315/). GAD65 and GAD67 are two enzymes responsible for GABA synthesis; these enzymes are often downregulated in individuals with epilepsy, resulting in diminished GABA availability [Treiman, 2001](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11520315/).

### Protein Synthesis Requirements for Neurotransmitter Receptors

**Glutamate receptor mRNAs (NMDAR1, AMPA receptors) can be translated in isolated dendrites**, and the presence of ionotropic glutamate receptor mRNAs in neuronal processes has been demonstrated [Steward & Schuman, 2001](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.97.21.11545). **The insertion of locally synthesized receptors into silent synapses may confer AMPA responsiveness to these synapses**, which is important for synaptic plasticity and learning [Steward & Schuman, 2001](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.97.21.11545).

**GABA is synthesized in the cytoplasm of the presynaptic neuron from the precursor glutamate by the enzyme glutamate decarboxylase (GAD), which uses vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) as a cofactor** [Möhler, 2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK513311/). The mRNA for GABA-A receptors has been found in dendrites [Steward & Schuman, 2001](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.97.21.11545).

**In the DRP1 mutation context with downregulated ribosome pathways, insufficient local translation of GABA receptors and glutamate receptors could directly contribute to excitatory-inhibitory imbalance and seizure susceptibility.**

## SynGO Database: Presynaptic and Postsynaptic Ribosome Annotations

### SynGO Overview

**SynGO is an evidence-based, expert-curated knowledge base for the synapse that uses Gene Ontology (GO) annotations to describe 87 synaptic locations and 179 synaptic processes** [Koopmans et al., 2019](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6764089/). Established in 2019, SynGO 1.0 releases 2,922 ontology-based descriptions of 1,112 unique synaptic genes, compiling published experimental information about localization and function of gene products at synapses [Koopmans et al., 2019](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6764089/).

### Ribosome Annotations in SynGO

**An important finding from research using SynGO relates to postsynaptic ribosomes**: one set of SynGO genes, the postsynaptic ribosome genes, was not significant when compared to all other genes but became significant when conditioned on brain-expressed genes [Koopmans et al., 2019](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6764089/). This suggests that **protein synthesis machinery is an important component of postsynaptic compartments**.

Recent research has confirmed that over 75% of both excitatory and inhibitory presynaptic terminals contain the machinery for protein synthesis (rRNA, ribosomes, polyadenylated mRNA), and there is notably high ongoing protein synthesis in both pre- and postsynaptic compartments [Hafner et al., 2019](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.aau3644).

**The user's finding of downregulated presynaptic and postsynaptic ribosome pathways (from SynGO enrichment analysis) in maturation-specific contrasts (D35→D65) is therefore highly significant**, indicating disruption of a fundamental synaptic maturation process during the critical period in DRP1 mutant neurons.

## Integrated Mechanistic Model: DRP1 Mutations → Ribosome Downregulation → Seizures

### Proposed Mechanistic Cascade

**1. Primary Defect: Mitochondrial Hyperfusion and Mispositioning**
- DRP1 G32A/R403C dominant-negative mutations block mitochondrial fission
- Hyperfused mitochondria fail to be properly distributed to dendrites and axons
- Synaptic regions lack adequate mitochondrial compartments

**2. Local Energy Crisis at Synapses**
- Spatially confined ATP depletion at pre- and postsynaptic sites
- Insufficient ATP for ribosome function (4 ATP/peptide bond) despite normal global ATP
- Mitochondrial compartments cannot anchor stably at synapses to fuel translation

**3. Downregulation of Synaptic Ribosome Pathways (SynGO Enrichment Finding)**
- Presynaptic ribosome pathway downregulation → reduced local synthesis of:
  - Synaptic vesicle proteins (SNAREs, synaptobrevin, syntaxin)
  - Mitochondrial proteins (as presynaptic ribosomes are tethered to Rab7a+ endosomes)
  - Neurotransmitter synthesis enzymes (GAD65/67 for GABA)
- Postsynaptic ribosome pathway downregulation → reduced local synthesis of:
  - AMPA receptors (GluA1, GluA2)
  - NMDA receptors (NMDAR1)
  - GABA-A receptors
  - PSD scaffolding proteins (PSD-95, SHANK)
  - Calcium channels and regulatory proteins

**4. Failed Synapse Maturation During Critical Period (D35→D65)**
- Reduced SYP/PSD95 colocalization (super-resolution microscopy findings)
- Decreased PSD95 volume in R403C neurons
- Aberrant synaptic density and network complexity
- Failure of activity-dependent synaptic refinement requiring local translation

**5. Aberrant Calcium Handling**
- NNAT upregulation (most significant DEG at D35) → ER calcium overload via SERCA2 inhibition
- CACNG3 downregulation (>2-fold at D65) → loss of AMPA receptor inhibition
- Dysregulated STIM/ORAI store-operated calcium entry
- Inappropriate expression of RYR1/ATP2A1 (muscle-type calcium handling)
- Result: Higher calcium amplitude, faster time-to-peak, slower clearance (observed in mutants)

**6. Excitatory-Inhibitory Imbalance**
- Insufficient local synthesis of GABA-A receptors at inhibitory synapses
- Reduced GAD65/67 synthesis → decreased GABA production
- Excessive AMPA receptor activity due to CACNG3 loss
- Enhanced NMDA receptor activity from calcium dysregulation
- Result: Network hyperexcitability

**7. Clinical Seizure Phenotype**
- Refractory epilepsy and status epilepticus
- Developmental regression after initial period
- Progressive neurodegeneration from chronic excitotoxicity
