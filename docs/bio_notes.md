# Biological Research Notes: DRP1 Mutations, Synaptic Ribosome Downregulation, and the Energy-Translation Crisis in Cortical Neuron Development

## Executive Summary

This document consolidates biological research supporting the mechanistic connections between DRP1 (DNM1L) loss-of-function mutations, mitochondrial hyperfusion, local synaptic energy deficits, ribosome downregulation, and epileptic encephalopathy. The central finding is that **mitochondrial mispositioning creates spatially-confined ATP depletion at synapses, triggering a paradoxical ribosome downregulation despite upregulated ribosome biogenesis**, leading to failed synaptogenesis during the critical developmental window (D35-D65) in hiPSC-derived cortical neurons.

**Key molecular events:**
- **Synaptic ribosome downregulation** creates an energy-translation crisis during the critical period of synaptogenesis
- Aberrant calcium handling?
- Failed synaptic maturation
- Neuronal hyperexcitability manifesting as refractory seizures

## Part I: DRP1 Mutations and Clinical Phenotype

### DNM1L-Related Epileptic Encephalopathy

De novo heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in DNM1L present in the first year of life with devastating neurodevelopmental phenotypes including severe epileptic encephalopathy, developmental delay, optic atrophy, and refractory seizures [Vanstone et al., 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5100740/). The most common clinical features include:
- Global developmental delay (12/13 cases)
- Refractory seizures and status epilepticus (8/13)
- Hypotonia
- Respiratory distress

**DNM1L encodes dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1/DLP1), a key component of the mitochondrial fission machinery that is essential to proper functioning of the mammalian brain** [PubMed 27145208](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27145208/). Autosomal dominant and recessive variants cause encephalopathy due to defective mitochondrial and peroxisomal fission 1 (EMPF1), a complex and clinically heterogeneous neurological disorder of variable severity, often accompanied by seizures.

Previously reported patients with de novo missense mutations presented with severe encephalopathy and refractory epilepsy, with most patients not surviving past childhood or early adolescence [Vanstone et al., 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5100740/).

### Dominant-Negative Mechanisms of G32A and R403C Mutations

**Both G32A (GTPase domain) and R403C (stalk domain) act as dominant-negative mutations** that disrupt DRP1 oligomerization and recruitment to mitochondria [Vanstone et al., 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5100740/). When mCherry-tagged DRP1-G32A and DRP1-R403C were overexpressed in wild-type fibroblasts, these mutations caused mitochondrial hyperfusion in a dominant-negative manner.

Both patient fibroblast lines showed increased mitochondrial volume, surface area, and major axis length consistent with hyperfused mitochondrial morphology, with G32A showing slightly more severe elongation than R403C [Vanstone et al., 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5100740/).

The R403C mutation reduces oligomerization, mitochondrial fission activity, and mitochondrial recruitment of DRP1, but to a lesser extent compared to other mutations like A395D [PubMed 36763487](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36763487/).

**Critical mechanistic insight: EMPF1-associated mutations do not appear to alter the capacity of DRP1 to be recruited to points of fission, but rather cause stalling of the fission events** [PubMed 36763487](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36763487/). This explains why hyperfused mitochondria accumulate but fission machinery is still recruited to constriction sites.

### Synaptic Maturation Defects in Patient Neurons (Khanal et al., 2024)

**Recent research reveals mutation-specific effects on synaptic development**: High-resolution time-lapse imaging of axonal transport in mutant DRP1 cortical neurons reveals mutation-specific changes in mitochondrial motility of severely hyperfused mitochondrial structures [Khanal et al., 2024](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11370610/).

Key findings:
- Mutant DRP1 neurons maintained highly elongated mitochondria within their axons throughout maturation (D35-D65)
- **Transcriptional profiling revealed mutation-dependent alterations in synaptic development and calcium regulation gene expression**
- **Deficits in pre- and post-synaptic marker colocalization using super-resolution microscopy strongly suggest that altered mitochondrial morphology leads to pathogenic dysregulation of synaptic development and activity**
- RNA-seq results reveal differences in gene expression between DRP1 mutant cultures, supporting a possible structure-function relationship between mutations in specific DRP1 domains and downstream patient phenotypes

Notable gene expression changes:
- Significantly decreased expression of PCDHGC3 (neural cadherin-like cell adhesion protein)
- Decreased PNPO (enzyme required for B6 and neurotransmitter synthesis)
- **NNAT was the first and third most significantly differentially expressed gene in both R403C and G32A mutants at D35**, suggesting profound dysregulation of ER calcium handling

### Phenotype-Genotype Correlations

The clinical phenotype depends on the degree of mitochondrial fission deficiency, ranging from severe encephalopathy and death shortly after birth to initially normal development and then sudden onset of refractory status epilepticus with very poor neurologic outcome [PubMed 30939602](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30939602/).

**2025 case reports continue to document the severity**: Structural modeling of p.(Gly401Ser) predicted interference of the mutant protein in self-oligomerization of the DRP1 active complex [PubMed 39859560](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39859560/). DNM1L-related phenotypes include static or (early) lethal encephalopathy, neurodevelopmental disorders, ophthalmological impairment, peripheral neuropathy, ataxia, dystonia, spasticity, myoclonus, and myopathy. Few pathogenic variants, including p.(Gly401Ser), cause encephalocardiomyopathy with refractory status epilepticus.

## Part II: Mitochondrial Hyperfusion and Bioenergetic Consequences

### Mitochondrial Membrane Hyperpolarization and Cristae Defects

**The inability of DRP1 to fragment mitochondria in patient-derived fibroblasts not only leads to the hyperfusion phenotype but also to:**
- Delayed cell death in response to apoptotic signals
- Aberrant mitochondrial cristae structure
- Hyperpolarized mitochondrial membrane potential

[DRP1 mutations EMPF1](https://journals.biologists.com/jcs/article/136/3/jcs260370/286985/DRP1-mutations-associated-with-EMPF1)

**Mitochondrial hyperfusion results in aberrant cristae structure and hyperpolarized mitochondrial membrane potential, both of which are tightly linked to changes in metabolism.** Pausing peroxisomal and mitochondrial fission results in:
- Alterations of cristae structure
- Changes in mitochondrial membrane potential
- Decreased mitochondrial coupling efficiency
- Delayed cell death response
- Overall metabolic adaptations

### Coupling Efficiency and ATP Production

**Metabolically, changes in mitochondrial and peroxisomal morphology result in inefficiency of ETC coupling oxygen consumption with ATP production, upregulation of glycolysis and overall metabolic reprogramming** [DRP1 mutations EMPF1](https://journals.biologists.com/jcs/article/136/3/jcs260370/286985/DRP1-mutations-associated-with-EMPF1).

In addition to elongated mitochondrial morphology and lack of fission, patient cells display:
- Lower coupling efficiency
- Increased proton leak
- Upregulation of glycolysis
[PubMed 36763487](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36763487/)

Inhibition of mitochondrial fission through Drp1 modulation impairs mitochondrial function: HeLa cells with reduced Drp1 expression showed decreased complex IV activity and a decrease in both state 3 respiration (maximal ATP synthesis rates) and state 4 respiration [PMC 5297777](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5297777/).

### Cristae Junction Regulation of Membrane Potential

**The crista junction (CJ) serves as an important barrier separating the cristae (CM) and inner boundary membranes (IBM), thereby regulating the movement of ions and ensuring distinct electrical potentials across the cristae (ΔΨC) and inner boundary (ΔΨIBM) membranes** [Scientific Reports](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-65595-z).

Dynamic multi-parameter correlation measurements revealed a CJ-based membrane potential overflow valve mechanism protecting mitochondrial integrity during excessive cristae hyperpolarization.

## Part III: Mitochondrial Positioning and Local ATP Supply at Synapses

### The Critical Role of Mitochondrial Positioning

**ATP has a limited diffusion capacity in the intracellular environment, particularly within long neuronal processes. Stationary mitochondria are needed to provide local sources of ATP**, which is necessary for:
- Na+/K+ ATPase activity
- Fast spike propagation
- Synaptic transmission
[PMC 4962561](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4962561/)

Approximately two-thirds of the mitochondrial population are stationary in mature neurons. These immobilized mitochondria either have dissociated from transport motors or are anchored to the cytoskeleton. Syntaphilin was identified as a "static anchor" for axonal mitochondria.

### DRP1 Function in Neuronal Mitochondrial Dynamics

DRP1 is recruited to the mitochondrial outer membrane by receptors including Fis1, MFF, MiD49, and MiD51, where it oligomerizes to mediate mitochondrial fission [Breckenridge et al., 2020](https://portlandpress.com/neuronalsignal/article/4/2/NS20200008/224381/Mechanisms-and-roles-of-mitochondrial-localisation).

**Mitochondrial fission is required for the proper distribution of mitochondria in dendrites and axons**, as Drp1 deficiency results in:
- Depletion of mitochondria from developing neurites
- Reduced neurite outgrowth
- Impaired synapse formation
- Neurodegeneration
[Ishihara et al., 2009](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5394918/)

### Synaptic Mitochondria as Energy Hubs

**Mitochondria accumulate at synaptic regions where they provide proper energy supply for synaptic signaling** [Breckenridge et al., 2020](https://portlandpress.com/neuronalsignal/article/4/2/NS20200008/224381/Mechanisms-and-roles-of-mitochondrial-localisation).

The large size of many neurons precludes rapid diffusion of ATP from one end of the cell to the other, implying that energy production must be spatially matched to local energy usage, requiring mitochondria to be located close to sites of ion influxes that generate synaptic and action potentials [Rangaraju et al., 2019](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/39/42/8200).

### Mitochondria Support Local Protein Synthesis

**Mitochondria are involved in local protein synthesis, protein transport, and Ca2+ buffering critical for synapse maintenance and structural dynamics** [eLife 89682](https://elifesciences.org/articles/89682).

**Experiments have shown that oxidative phosphorylation by mitochondria is needed for dendritic protein translation, not glycolysis, and that it contributes a majority of the energy consumed at the postsynaptic site by receptor and ion channel activation.**

Transcriptomic studies suggested that a large portion of proteins present in dendrites and at dendritic spines can be synthesized locally based on mRNA specifically transported to this compartment, revealing enormous potential for the local protein synthesis machinery to supply, maintain, and modify the dendritic and synaptic proteome.

### Activity-Dependent Mitochondrial Recruitment

**Neuronal activity drives ATP generation, confirming that OXPHOS is the major source of energy during neuronal activity and synaptic transmission** to support:
- Spine growth
- Cytoskeletal rearrangements
- Protein synthesis
[Cell Mol Life Sci](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00018-023-04814-8)

**Increasing synaptic activity decreases the motion of dendritic mitochondria and enhances their localization at synapses.** During postsynaptic depolarization, dendritic mitochondria become clustered at the base of spines and protrude into them. Activation of glutamate receptors with exogenous or synaptically released glutamate recruits mitochondria to synapses.

### Spatial Compartmentalization of ATP for Translation and Plasticity

**Critical Discovery (Rangaraju et al., 2019)**: Spatially stable dendritic mitochondrial compartments fuel local translation during synaptic plasticity within spatially confined boundaries [Rangaraju et al., 2019](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092867418316271). These dendritic mitochondria exist as stable compartments of single or multiple filaments that are surprisingly stable, anchored via the cytoskeleton, and can remain in place for over an hour [Rangaraju et al., 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-44233-8).

**Depletion of local mitochondrial compartments abolished both plasticity and stimulus-induced synaptic translation**, demonstrating that local ATP production is essential for synaptic protein synthesis.

While global ATP levels are adequate for basal translation, **mitochondrial compartments anchored nearby are required to power local translation for the enhanced energy demands associated with synaptic plasticity** [Lee et al., 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8317219/).

**Critical 2025 Discovery (bioRxiv 2025)**: Synapses require an instant and local energy supply provided by mitochondria stabilized near dendritic spines. Using highly sensitive spine- and mitochondrial ATP reporters, researchers found that **synaptic plasticity input drives instant and sustained increase in spine ATP levels, provided by local ATP synthesis in ~10-20 μm spatially confined compartments within mitochondria** [bioRxiv 2025](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.09.648032v1.full).

**MINFLUX Nanoscopy Finding (2025)**: Probing single molecules reveals that mitochondrial inner membrane proteins reorganize during synaptic plasticity in dendritic spines of engram cells. Using 3D MINFLUX nanoscopy, researchers identified a significant redistribution of α-F1-ATP synthase correlating with learning-related activities, suggesting a pivotal role for polarized ATP synthesis near the postsynaptic zone in modulating synaptic plasticity [Nature Comms Bio 2025](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-025-08963-3).

### Connection to Presynaptic Function

**The availability of presynaptic mitochondria at axonal release sites directly influences synaptic function** [eNeuro 2018](https://www.eneuro.org/content/5/1/ENEURO.0390-17.2018).

**Local axonal protein synthesis has been shown to be required for the maintenance of mitochondrial function. It is very likely that local presynaptic signaling mechanisms regulate the expression of mitochondrial proteins in axons, thereby controlling mitochondrial ultrastructure and performance** [EMBO reports](https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/embr.201948882).

## Part IV: Synaptic Ribosomes and Local Protein Synthesis

### Ubiquitous Presence of Ribosomes at Synapses

**Landmark Finding (Hafner et al., 2019)**: Over 75% of both excitatory and inhibitory presynaptic terminals in the hippocampus and forebrain contain the machinery for protein synthesis: rRNA, ribosomes, and polyadenylated mRNA [Hafner et al., 2019](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aau3644).

In adult rodent brain slices and cultured neurons, both light microscopy and electron microscopy revealed that in the absence of overt stimulation, there was a notably high level of ongoing protein synthesis in both pre- and postsynaptic compartments.

**After just 5 minutes of metabolic labeling, approximately 40% of both excitatory and inhibitory presynaptic terminals and ~60% of dendritic spines exhibited active translation.**

In mammalian CNS neurons, electron microscopy has visualized polyribosomes present in dendritic shafts as well as at the base and interior of dendritic spines [Steward & Schuman, 2001](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.97.21.11545).

### Presynaptic Ribosomes and Active Translation

Researchers have shown an essential ribosomal component, 5.8S rRNA, at a glutamatergic nerve terminal in the mammalian brain and demonstrated active translation in nerve terminals in situ in brain slices, showing ongoing presynaptic protein synthesis [eLife 36697](https://elifesciences.org/articles/36697).

**Shortly after inhibiting translation, the presynaptic terminal exhibits:**
- Increased spontaneous release
- Increased paired pulse ratio
- Increased vesicle replenishment rate during stimulation trains
- Reduced initial probability of release

This suggests that ongoing protein synthesis can limit excessive vesicle release, conserving energy required for maintaining synaptic transmission.

Presynaptic ribosomes, tethered to Rab7a-containing endosomal vesicles, drive the translation of mRNAs relevant to mitochondrial functions [Cioni et al., 2019](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.aau3644). This co-localization suggests coordinated regulation of energy metabolism and local protein synthesis at presynaptic sites.

### Presynaptic FMRP and Structural Plasticity

The mouse hippocampal mossy fiber (MF)-CA3 synapse expresses both structural and functional presynaptic plasticity and contains presynaptic fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein (FMRP), an RNA-binding protein involved in postsynaptic protein-synthesis-dependent plasticity [PMC 9391299](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9391299/). MF boutons contain ribosomes and synthesize protein locally.

**Long-term potentiation of MF-CA3 synaptic transmission (MF-LTP) was associated with translation-dependent enlargement of MF boutons.** Increasing in vitro or in vivo MF activity enhanced protein synthesis in MFs, and deletion of presynaptic FMRP blocked structural and functional MF-LTP.

### mRNA Localization to Synaptic Compartments

**mRNA translation is regulated locally in neuronal dendrites, axons, dendritic spines, presynaptic boutons, or axonal growth cones** [Frontiers Mol Neuro](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/molecular-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2022.823135/full).

**Variability in local protein synthesis is critical for neuronal development, maintenance, synaptic signaling, and plasticity. Disruptions of activity-induced local translation have drastic consequences leading to cognitive deficits observed in several neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases.**

**Omic studies have revealed that over 1000 mRNAs are present and can be selectively locally translated in presynaptic and postsynaptic compartments from development to adulthood in vivo** [Sutton & Schuman, 2006](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8161363/). At both embryonic and adult stages, axons are enriched for mRNAs encoding ribosomal and mitochondrial proteins [Cioni et al., 2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7536069/).

### Postsynaptic Protein Synthesis and Receptor Trafficking

**Long-term potentiation (LTP) involves the insertion of additional AMPA receptors into the postsynaptic membrane by a combination of exocytosis and lateral diffusion** [Henley & Wilkinson, 2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3622464/).

Glutamate receptor mRNAs (including NMDAR1, GABA-A receptors, and Ca2+ channels) can be translated in isolated dendrites, and dendritic protein synthesis is required for long-term changes in synaptic efficacy [Steward & Schuman, 2001](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.97.21.11545).

**Spine enlargement occurs concurrently with AMPAR recruitment, leading to correlated spine size and synaptic transmission.** The late phase of LTP, which lasts days or even weeks, requires gene transcription and new protein synthesis, while the induction phase occurs without synthesis of new proteins, relying on post-translational modifications.

## Part V: Energy Cost of Translation and the ATP-Ribosome Coupling

### The 4 ATP Equivalents Per Peptide Bond

**The main energetic cost in cells is peptide bond formation at the ribosome. It consumes 4 ATP equivalents per peptide bond formed** [PMC 2632092](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2632092/); [PMC 7616719](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7616719/).

**Detailed Breakdown:**

1. **Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthesis (2 ATP equivalents):**
   - AARSs activate amino acids to aminoacyl-adenylates by transferring an AMP residue from ATP with concurrent release of PPi
   - Then transfer the aminoacyl moiety to the corresponding tRNA molecule
   - The two-step AARS reaction generates AMP and PPi, whereby PPi is immediately hydrolyzed to two Pi by ubiquitous pyrophosphatases, making the process irreversible
   [Biology Stack Exchange](https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/40964/how-much-nucleoside-triphosphate-is-required-to-form-one-peptide-bond-during-pro)

2. **Ribosome Translation (2 GTP):**
   - The cost and energy currency of elongation and translocation at the ribosome is two GTP per peptide bond formed
   - The energetic cost of translation is incurred at the elongation and translocation phase, which require two GTPases: elongation factors EF-Tu and EF-G
   [PMC 7616719](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7616719/)

### Cellular Energy Budget for Translation

**Broken down across the total ATP pool, roughly:**
- 34% is expended for irreversible reactions (mostly to make translation irreversible)
- 38% is expended for biosynthesis
- 27% is converted to GTP for translation
[BNID 107782](https://bionumbers.hms.harvard.edu/bionumber.aspx?s=n&v=0&id=107782)

**Most cellular ATP is utilized in protein synthesis via tRNA aminoacylation and GTP regeneration** [PMC 5500012](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5500012/).

**Neuronal activity-induced protein synthesis is responsible for significant ATP expenditure**, and perturbing mitochondrial function that colocalizes with translational hotspots at neurite branch points impairs branch-point protein synthesis and branch stabilization [Spillane et al., 2013](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/molecular-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2022.823135/full).

### Additional Costs: Error Correction and Quality Control

The addition of an amino acid to a growing peptide chain requires:
- 2 ATP for amino acid activation
- 2 ATP for peptide bond formation and ribosome translation
- Plus additional costs (~1 ATP) for error correction and synthesis of sequences removed during protein maturation
[NCBI Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK224633/)

Certain amino acids (e.g., val and ile) are sufficiently similar that aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases have evolved proofreading capacity, in which incorrectly aminoacylated tRNA is hydrolyzed [Protein Synthesis Maturation](http://www2.csudh.edu/nsturm/CHEMXL153/ProteinSynthesisMaturation.htm).

## Part VI: Ribosome Biogenesis Stress Responses and the Translation Paradox

### The Ribosome Assembly Stress Response (RASTR)

**Under various stress conditions (including RASTR, heat shock, TORC1 inhibition), levels of unassembled ribosomal proteins (RPs) increase dramatically, and RPs accumulate with nucleolar proteins, Ifh1 and chaperones in an insoluble nuclear or nucleolar fraction** [eLife 45002](https://elifesciences.org/articles/45002).

This leads to:
- Rapid upregulation of Hsf1 target genes (chaperones and proteasome components) through Hsp70 titration
- Coincident downregulation of RP genes through Ifh1 sequestration

**Given the extremely high level of ribosomal protein (RP) synthesis in rapidly growing cells, alteration of any step in the ribosome assembly process may impact growth by leading to proteotoxic stress.**

### The Ribosome Biogenesis Stress Response (RiBiSR)

**In response to stress, the integrated stress response (ISR) rapidly inhibits global translation. Stress specifically inhibits the first step of rRNA processing** [bioRxiv 2020](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.16.250183v1.full).

**Unprocessed rRNA is stored within the nucleolus, and when stress resolves, it re-enters the ribosome biogenesis pathway.** Retention of unprocessed rRNA within the nucleolus aids in the maintenance of this organelle.

This response is independent of the ISR or inhibition of cellular translation but represents an independent stress-response pathway termed Ribosome Biogenesis Stress Response (RiBiSR).

### Translation Stress Paradox

**In the case of dysfunctional mRNA translation, stress signals from polysomes activate PI3Kδ and trigger a novel signaling pathway independent of AKT and mTOR**, resulting in increased translation of E2F1 mRNA [MDPI translation stress](https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/19/12/3757). The newly synthesized active E2F1, in turn, stimulates downstream transcription targets c-Myc and cyclins to induce ribosome biogenesis and cell proliferation.

### Ribosome Hibernation During Energy Stress

**Cell survival under nutrient-deprived conditions relies on cells' ability to adapt their organelles and rewire their metabolic pathways. In yeast, glucose depletion induces a stress response mediated by mitochondrial fragmentation and sequestration of cytosolic ribosomes on mitochondria** [Nature Comms 2024](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-52911-4).

Biochemical analyses suggest a halt of protein synthesis by day 4 of glucose depletion:
- Decline in polysome amounts
- Accumulation of 80S monosomes
- Cryo-EM reveals inactive ribosomal state lacking both tRNA and mRNA
- Conformational changes in peptidyl transferase center disrupt inter-subunit bridge B2a (integral for translation)

### ATP-Mg2+-Ribosome Interplay

**Even though ATP powers virtually all energy-dependent activity, most cellular ATP is utilized in protein synthesis via tRNA aminoacylation and GTP regeneration. Magnesium (Mg2+), the most common divalent cation in living cells, plays crucial roles in protein synthesis by:**
- Maintaining the structure of ribosomes
- Participating in the biochemistry of translation initiation
- Functioning as a counter-ion for ATP
[PMC 5500012](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5500012/)

Organisms cope with Mg2+ limitation by decreasing ATP levels and ribosome production, thereby reallocating Mg2+ to indispensable cellular processes.

**Paradoxically, translational arrest leads to accumulation of ATP. Despite the large amount of ribosomes and high levels of energy in the cell, protein synthesis is suspended due to lack of free Mg2+, and cells stop growing** [PMC 4531837](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4531837/).

---

## Part VII: Mitochondrial Compensation: OXPHOS and Mitoribosome Upregulation

### OXPHOS Deficiency Triggers Adaptive Responses

**Yeast oxidative phosphorylation mutants deficient in complex III, IV, V, and mtDNA exhibit activated stress responses and progressive reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm)** [EMBO reports 2021](https://www.embopress.org/doi/abs/10.15252/embr.202051606).

These mutants progressively activate adaptive responses:
- Transcriptional downregulation of ATP synthase inhibitor Inh1 and OXPHOS subunits
- Puf3-mediated upregulation of import receptor Mia40 and global mitochondrial biogenesis
- Snf1/AMPK-mediated upregulation of glycolysis and repression of ribosome biogenesis
- Transcriptional upregulation of cytoplasmic chaperones

**Gene ontology analysis showed that the three most downregulated biological processes in ρ0 cells all relate to ribosome biogenesis and mainly consist of transcripts encoding ribosome subunits and ribosome processing/assembly factors. The most-upregulated processes are mitochondrial translation, mitochondrial gene expression, and carbohydrate metabolic process (glucose transporters and glycolysis genes).**

### Mitonuclear Translation Balance Disruption

**Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes consist of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA-encoded subunits. Their biogenesis requires cross-compartment gene regulation to mitigate the accumulation of disproportionate subunits** [Genome Biology 2022](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-022-02732-9).

**When mitochondrial gene expression is constitutively impaired, a compensatory reduction in nuclear OXPHOS expression does not occur**, suggesting that these cells lack active feedback mechanisms to maintain mitonuclear translational balance. Ongoing cytosolic translation despite a repression of mitochondrial protein synthesis resulted in unbalanced translatomes, which lead to the upregulation of proteostasis genes.

### Structural Evolution of Mitoribosomes and OXPHOS Complexes

**Mitoribosomes have evolved similarly to mitochondrial OXPHOS complexes via two distinct phases:**
1. A constructive phase that mainly acted early in eukaryote evolution, resulting in recruitment of ~75 novel subunits
2. A reductive phase that acted during metazoan evolution, resulting in gradual length-reduction of mitochondrially encoded rRNAs and OXPHOS proteins
[PMC 4453056](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4453056/)

**The main role of the newly recruited nuclear-encoded ribosomal and OXPHOS proteins is to provide structural compensation to the mutationally destabilized mitochondrially encoded components.**

### mtDNA Maintenance and Mitoribosome Assembly Coupling

**In cases of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion, which reduces 12S and 16S rRNA levels, mitoribosome assembly is halted due to insufficient rRNA substrates, preventing the formation of functional subunits and linking mtDNA maintenance to translational capacity** [PubMed 27023847](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27023847/).

**The binding of mitochondrial ribosomal protein L12 (MRPL12) directly to POLRMT may couple transcription and translation directly or provide a means to coordinate transcription of mtDNA-encoded rRNAs with the import of nucleus-encoded mitochondrial ribosomal proteins.** This poses the possibility that key aspects of mitochondrial ribosome assembly are monitored by cells, perhaps as a signal to determine the rate of overall mitochondrial biogenesis or as a metric of mitochondrial functional capacity.

### Integrated Stress Response (ISR) in Mitochondrial Dysfunction

Studies have shown that the activation of the integrated stress response (ISR) is a hallmark of mitochondrial dysfunction and that the general retrograde signal is coordinated by ATF4 downstream of eIF2α phosphorylation [ScienceDirect ISR](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2468867322000736). A major study by Quirós et al. in HeLa cells demonstrated that ATF4 is responsible for the cytoprotective response that leads to transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolic adaptation.

**Both genetic and pharmacological mitochondrial OxPhos defects trigger marked hypermetabolism in a cell-autonomous manner** [Nature Comms Bio 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-022-04303-x). mtDNA instability, activation of the ISR, increased secretory activity, and transcriptional upregulation of transcriptional/translational stress pathways have been identified as potential contributors to hypermetabolism.

## Part VIII: Calcium Dysregulation in DRP1 Mutant Neurons

### NNAT (Neuronatin): ER Calcium Store Dysregulation

**Neuronatin is a small membrane protein localized predominantly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)** and exists in two isoforms (α and β having 81 and 54 amino acids respectively) [PMC 3173491](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3173491/).

**NNAT is localized in the ER and mediates neural induction through an increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+ level by inhibiting SERCA2** (sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase isoform 2) [Lin et al., 2010](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3003906/).

**NNAT initiates neural induction in embryonic stem cells through increasing intracellular Ca2+ by antagonizing SERCA2 in the ER, which increases phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and inhibits the BMP4 pathway.** Overexpression of NNAT recapitulates spine loss and ER calcium overload in cortical neurons with PSEN1 mutation [Munguba et al., 2022](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9012292/).

**Neuronatin (NNAT) is a developmentally regulated ER resident protein and negative regulator of SERCA that is expressed in the brain's PVALB+ GABAergic neurons; NNAT has also been implicated in abnormal neurodevelopment, including ASD and Angelman Syndrome (AS)** [Frontiers Mol Neuro](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/molecular-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00035/full).

**In the DRP1 mutation context:** NNAT was the first and third most significantly differentially expressed gene in both R403C and G32A mutants at D35 [Khanal et al., 2024](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11370610/), suggesting profound dysregulation of ER calcium handling during the critical period of synaptogenesis.

### SERCA2 and Calcium Homeostasis

**Intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis greatly relies on the rapid redistribution of Ca2+ ions into diverse subcellular organelles including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Ca2+ released into the neuronal cytoplasm is pumped back into the ER by SERCA2, a P-type ion-motive ATPase that resides on the ER membrane** [PubMed 29663107](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29663107/).

**SERCA2-dependent Ca2+ dysregulation has been implicated in several disorders that affect cognitive function**, including Darier's disease, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, and cerebral ischemia.

### CACNG3: AMPA Receptor Modulation and Excitability

**The calcium channel γ subunit CACNG3 is a modulator of AMPA receptors at postsynaptic membranes**, and their function in trafficking of AMPA receptors is more clear than their association with calcium channel complexes [Burgess et al., 2001](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4691803/).

**Genetic studies have identified a region within chromosome 22q13.1 containing the CACNG2 locus in families with epilepsy. CACNG2 and CACNG3, encoding voltage-dependent calcium channel γ-subunits 2 and 3, regulate glutamate signaling as TARPs, and AMPA receptor-TARP complexes are involved in long-term potentiation and depression** [Dovepress JRLCR](https://www.dovepress.com/the-ampa-receptor-as-a-therapeutic-target-in-epilepsy-preclinical-and--peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-JRLCR).

Mutations in the γ2 subunit protein (stargazin) have been found in stargazer and waggler mouse epilepsy models, and some or all of the phenotype associated with mutations could involve AMPA-mediated signaling [Burgess et al., 2001](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4691803/).

**Fast synaptic excitation within brain regions relevant to epilepsy is mediated predominantly by AMPA receptors, and AMPA receptor antagonists markedly reduce or abolish epileptiform activity in experimental models** [Rogawski, 2011](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4506648/).

**In DRP1 mutant neurons:**
- CACNG3 showed >2-fold decrease at D65 in both mutants
- Mutants displayed significantly higher mean amplitude of calcium fluorescence after glutamate stimulation
- Faster time-to-peak calcium response
- The area under the curve was significantly higher in G32A cultures, indicating slower calcium clearance
[Khanal et al., 2024](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11370610/)

### Stargazin Model of Absence Epilepsy

Mutations in CACNG2 are implicated in the stargazer mouse model of absence epilepsy, where **defective stargazin leads to mistrafficking of AMPA receptors in fast-spiking parvalbumin-positive interneurons of the neocortex and reticular thalamic nucleus, resulting in network disinhibition and hyperexcitability** [PMC 3164835](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3164835/).

**Stargazer mice are characterized by ataxia and seizures, which resemble human absence epilepsy** [Journal of Neuroscience 2008](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/28/42/10599). **Decreased nRT neuron excitability caused by the loss of AMPARs may limit their participation within the thalamocortical network, and eventually lead to disinhibition and absence-like seizures.**

### GAERS Model Findings

Absence-like seizures in the Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg (GAERS) model are believed to arise in hyperexcitable somatosensory cortical neurons [ScienceDirect GAERS](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0969996111000040).

**Expression of the TARP stargazin is elevated in the somatosensory cortex of GAERS.** Elevated stargazin in GAERS is associated with an increase in AMPA receptor proteins, GluA1 and GluA2, in the somatosensory cortex plasma membrane of adult epileptic GAERS.

### RYR1 and ATP2A1: Muscle-Type Calcium Handling in Neurons

While RYR1 (ryanodine receptor 1) is found exclusively in Purkinje cells in the cerebellum under normal conditions [Wojcikiewicz, 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/inositol-trisphosphate-receptor), its abnormal expression in cortical neurons may indicate aberrant developmental programming or inappropriate muscle-like excitation-contraction coupling mechanisms.

Similarly, ATP2A1 (SERCA1) is predominantly a fast-twitch skeletal muscle isoform of the ER calcium pump. The presence of these muscle-type calcium handling genes in the RNA-seq dataset from cortical neurons suggests potential developmental dysregulation or compensatory mechanisms in response to ER stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in DRP1 mutant neurons.

### Store-Operated Calcium Entry (SOCE): STIM and ORAI

**SOCE is mediated by stromal interaction molecule (STIM) in the ER membrane and calcium release-activated calcium modulator 1 (ORAI) on the plasma membrane** [Yuan et al., 2009](https://biosignaling.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12964-024-02014-w).

**SOCE plays a critical role in many calcium-dependent processes in neurons and glial cells, influencing neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity. SOCE in neural cells is mediated by:**
- STIM1 and STIM2 (ER calcium sensors)
- Orai1, Orai2, Orai3 (calcium-selective channels in plasma membrane)
[Frontiers Cell Neuro](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cellular-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fncel.2015.00153/full)

Upon depletion of calcium stores, STIM undergoes conformational changes, assembles into oligomers, activates ORAI, and promotes influx of extracellular calcium.

**STIM proteins actively modulate neurotransmission by inhibiting both voltage-gated calcium channels and NMDA receptors**, and they regulate AMPA receptor trafficking and can increase the number and stability of mushroom spines via a CaMKII and EB3/microtubules-dependent pathway [Popugaeva & Bezprozvanny, 2013](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2012.00061/full).

**Developmental expression patterns:**
- STIM1 is more mobile primarily in young neurons (associated with spontaneous calcium sparks and formation/elongation of dendritic filopodia/spines)
- STIM2 is less mobile and more prominent in older neurons in culture (moves into dendritic spines primarily when cytosolic Ca2+ levels are reduced)
[Frontiers Syn Neuro](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/synaptic-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.573714/full)

### IP3R and RyR Calcium Release Channels

**The inositol trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) and ryanodine receptor (RyR) are ER-resident Ca2+ channels that mediate the generation of ER-generated Ca2+ signals** [Foskett et al., 2021](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00033.2020).

Rodent hippocampal neurons chiefly express the IP3R1 and RyR2 isoforms, though RyR1 is found exclusively in Purkinje cells in the cerebellum [Wojcikiewicz, 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/inositol-trisphosphate-receptor).

**Ca2+ release contributes to neuronal excitability and neurotransmitter release by increasing cytosolic Ca2+, influencing synaptic vesicle exocytosis and neurotransmission** [Ruiz et al., 2009](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0050066). Calcium release mediated by neuronal IP3R1 or RyR2 channels made significant contributions to activity-induced nuclear and mitochondrial Ca2+ signal generation [Bootman et al., 2025](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006291X25001597).

### Mitochondria-ER Contact Sites (MAMs) and Calcium Transfer

**Mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs) are lipid raft-like regions where the ER physically contacts mitochondria, playing important roles in lipid synthesis, calcium homeostasis, and apoptotic signaling** [Area-Gomez & Schon, 2016](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1300677110).

**MAMs are direct contact sites between the ER and mitochondria that serve as platforms to coordinate fundamental cellular processes:**
- Mitochondrial dynamics and bioenergetics
- Calcium and lipid homeostasis
- Autophagy, apoptosis, inflammation
- Intracellular stress responses
[Frontiers Neuro 2021](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.715945/full)

The molecular chaperone glucose-regulated protein 75 (Grp75) facilitates the ER-mitochondria interaction by forming a tethering complex within the MAM, crucial for bidirectional calcium transfer between these organelles.

**MERCs (mitochondria-ER contact sites) provide a direct avenue for calcium transfer from the ER to the mitochondria.** Because the concentration of ER calcium is several orders of magnitude higher than cytosolic calcium, the existence of these contact sites can result in a direct conduit for increasing mitochondrial calcium concentration [npj Sys Bio](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41540-021-00185-7).

**In neurons, the interaction between ER and mitochondria in synapses has been postulated to shape intracellular Ca2+ signals and modulate synaptic and integrative neuronal activities.** By serving as a direct conduit for Ca2+ influx from the cytosol, MERCs play an important role in localizing Ca2+ and thereby increasing ATP production locally at active synapses.

## Part IX: Activity-Dependent Translation and CaMKII-mTOR Signaling

### CaMKII's Central Role in Synaptic Plasticity

**Calcium-calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) has a central role in synaptic plasticity, learning and memory** [Nature Rev Neuro 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-022-00624-2). It is activated by intracellular increases in calcium ion levels and triggers molecular processes necessary for synaptic plasticity. CaMKII phosphorylates numerous synaptic proteins, thereby regulating their structure and functions.

**LTP induction results in calcium entry, which activates CaMKII. CaMKII subsequently translocates to the synapse, where it binds to NMDA-type glutamate receptors and produces potentiation by phosphorylating principal and auxiliary subunits of AMPA-type glutamate receptors** [Yasuda, 2022](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36056211/). These processes are localized to stimulated spines and account for the synapse specificity of LTP. In the later stages of LTP, CaMKII has a structural role in enlarging and strengthening the synapse.

**Spaced stimulation rapidly increases presynaptic CaMKII through local translation of pre-existing mRNA, independently of somatic factors** [Rangaraju et al., 2024](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.11.03.686364v1). mRNA translation happens in synaptic locations including dendrites and dendritic spines, which contain polyribosomes, translation factors, and mRNAs.

**Activity-dependent synthesis requires CaMKII T287 autophosphorylation-induced activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway** [Rangaraju et al., 2024](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.11.03.686364v1).

### mTORC1 and Translation Initiation

**The formation of long-term memories depends on de novo protein synthesis, a process tightly regulated by the mechanistic/mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway** [Wiley JNC 2025](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jnc.70281).

**mTORC1 promotes mRNA translation initiation in the central nervous system, and research has uncovered that excitatory neurons, inhibitory neurons, and glia play distinct roles in modulating synaptic strength and encoding long-term memory via mTORC1 signaling** [Huang et al., 2025](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jnc.70281).

**LTP induction is triggered by Ca2+ influx through activated NMDARs, which then stimulates multiple signal transduction pathways.** The persistent increase of PKMζ protein through upregulation of PKMζ mRNA translation in LTP requires many of these transient, early signaling events, including NMDAR, CaMKII, ERK, PKA, and mTOR activation, BDNF signaling, and actin filament formation [Molecular Brain 2018](https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-018-0420-5).

### Activity-Dependent CaMKII Translocation

**In addition to its known accumulation at spines, dynamic recruitment of CaMKII to dendritic subdomains adjacent to activated synapses has been observed in cultured hippocampal neurons** [JCB 2012](https://rupress.org/jcb/article/198/6/1055/36963/Translocation-of-CaMKII-to-dendritic-microtubules).

This process was accompanied by the adjacent remodeling of spines and synaptic AMPA receptor insertion. Replacement of endogenous CaMKII with a mutant that cannot translocate within dendrites lessened this activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. Thus, CaMKII could decode compartmental dendritic Ca2+ transients to support remodeling of local synapses.

## Part X: Ribosomopathies and Epilepsy

### RPL10 Mutations: X-Linked Ribosomopathy with Epilepsy

**Ribosomopathies are characterized by syndromic disorders with microcephaly, growth retardation, and seizures** [Brooks et al., 2014](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25316788/).

**Mutations in the ribosomal protein gene RPL10 (uL16) were first discovered to be associated with autism. More recently, mutations in RPL10 (K78E) have been shown to cause X-linked microcephaly, intellectual disability, and seizures** [Genetics 2014](http://www.genetics.org/content/198/2/723.abstract).

Research has documented a multigenerational pedigree with an X-linked syndromic disorder hallmarked by microcephaly, growth retardation, and seizures [ScienceDirect Ribosomopathy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1769721217306961). Using next-generation sequencing, a novel missense mutation in RPL10 was identified, with the p.K78E change segregating with disease under an X-linked recessive paradigm.

**The p.K78E substitution appears to be associated with severe microcephaly, seizures, hearing loss, growth retardation, cardiac defects, and dysmorphic facial features.**

### RPS23 and Translational Accuracy

**Ribosomal protein gene mutations, mostly associated with inherited or acquired bone marrow failure, are believed to drive disease by slowing the rate of protein synthesis. De novo missense mutations in the RPS23 gene, which codes for uS12, have been reported in individuals with microcephaly** [PubMed 28257692](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28257692/).

**These uS12 variants impaired the accuracy of mRNA translation and rendered cells highly sensitive to oxidative stress.** These discoveries describe a ribosomopathy linked to uS12 and reveal mechanistic distinctions between RP gene mutations driving hematopoietic disease and those resulting in developmental disorders.

### EEF1A2: Translation Elongation Factor and Epilepsy

**Mutations in EEF1A2, a muscle- and neuron-specific translation factor, cause severe drug-resistant epilepsy, autism, and neurodevelopmental delay** [Nakajima et al., 2023](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2307704120).

These mutations cause:
- Decreased protein synthesis via reduced translation elongation
- Increased tRNA binding
- Decreased actin-bundling activity

In mouse cortical neurons, EEF1A2 mutations decrease de novo protein synthesis and alter neuronal morphology, acting via a toxic gain of function.

**The specificity of the disorder is determined by the expression pattern of eEF1A isoforms.** All vertebrates have two independently encoded isoforms of eEF1A; eEF1A1 is ubiquitously expressed throughout development but is then switched off specifically in neurons and muscle postnatally, where it is replaced by eEF1A2 [PubMed 30370994](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30370994/).

**Heterozygous de novo mutations in EEF1A2, encoding the tissue-specific translation elongation factor eEF1A2, have been shown to cause neurodevelopmental disorders including often severe epilepsy and intellectual disability** [PMC 4947865](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4947865/).

**In humans, there is evidence linking de novo dominant EEF1A2 mutations to extensive neurological deficits, including intractable epilepsy, global developmental delay, severe intellectual disability, hypotonia, and autistic behavior** [Nature Sci Reports 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep46019).

### EIF4A2: Developmental Epileptic Encephalopathy

**Alterations in the Eukaryotic Initiation Factor 4A2 (EIF4A2) gene have been identified as the cause of a novel developmental epileptic encephalopathy syndrome**, with EIF4A2 belonging to the DEAD-box family of proteins, many of which regulate protein translation [Jackson et al., 2022](https://www.texaschildrens.org/content/research/new-neurodevelopmental-epilepsy-disorder-and-its-genetic-cause-discovered).

### Ribosome Biogenesis and Neuronal Development

**Many neurodevelopmental defects are linked to genes encoding ribosome biogenesis factors** [Bhaduri et al., 2025](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-025-01708-8). **Ribosome levels decrease during neuroepithelial differentiation, making cells vulnerable to perturbations in ribosome biogenesis, which disrupts survival and cell fate commitment.**

### Mechanisms of Neurodevelopmental Pathology in Ribosomopathies

**Recent literature argues for a role of dysregulated ribosomal biogenesis in pathogenesis of various neurodevelopmental syndromes. This dysregulation may lead to cellular pathologies including:**
- Insufficient proliferation and/or loss of neuroprogenitor cells
- Apoptosis of immature neurons
- Altered neuronal morphogenesis
- Neurodegeneration
[PMC 6347560](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6347560/)

**The spectrum of neurodevelopmental disruption phenotypes includes brain malformations such as microcephaly, psychiatric disorders including intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorders, or schizophrenia, and various forms of epilepsy.**

**Research in Drosophila models has shown that the cellular stress in ribosomopathies is not caused by insufficient protein synthesis, as might be expected. Instead, ribosomal protein deficiency elicits proteotoxic stress, caused by the accumulation of misfolded proteins that overwhelm the protein degradation machinery** [Nature Cell Bio 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-020-00626-1).

## Part XI: Critical Period Plasticity and Synaptogenesis

### The Critical Period: Heightened Plasticity and Vulnerability

**Critical periods are postnatal, restricted time windows of heightened plasticity in cortical neural networks, during which experience refines principal neuron wiring configurations** [Frontiers Cell Neuro 2023](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cellular-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fncel.2023.1247335/full).

**The time window at the beginning of life in which external input signals are connected sensitively and strongly to neural circuit optimization is called the critical period** [PNAS 2020](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1820836117).

**In both the visual cortex and respiratory system regions, the critical period is a time of:**
- Heightened inhibition
- Reduced expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)
- Synaptic imbalance with heightened inhibition and suppressed excitation
[Royal Society B 2021](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2021.1025)

**Synaptic imbalance renders developing neurons more vulnerable to external stressors.** However, the critical period is necessary to enable each system to strengthen its circuitry, adapt to its environment, and transition from immaturity to maturity, when a state of relative synaptic balance is attained. **Failure to achieve such a balance leads to neurological disorders.**

During critical periods, cortical networks undergo many iterations of synaptogenesis, maturation, and pruning, becoming increasingly organized with selectively strengthened, stable connections [Hensch, 2020](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1820836117). **Experience-dependent regulation of synaptic strength establishes circuit functions that are stabilized as critical period plasticity wanes.**

### Silent Synapses and Critical Period Plasticity

**During this critical period, changes in motor neuron activity shaped the numbers and distribution of excitatory and inhibitory inputs onto motor dendrites in a homeostatic manner. The motor critical period is terminated by astrocyte maturation, and astrocyte-specific ablation delayed the closure of the motor critical period** [Frontiers Cell Neuro 2023](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cellular-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fncel.2023.1247335/full).

**Nascent gestalt synapses are constantly formed as AMPA receptor-silent synapses which are the substrates for critical period plasticity. Experience drives the unsilencing and stabilization of gestalt synapses, as well as synapse pruning** [PMC 7380267](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7380267/). This maturation process changes synapse patterning and consequently the functional architecture of cortical excitatory networks.

The cooperative yet opposing function of two postsynaptic signaling scaffolds, PSD-93 and PSD-95, governs the maturation of gestalt synapses [Frank et al., 2024](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-024-01728-x).

### Protein Synthesis Requirements During Critical Periods

**BDNF's normal role includes stimulating energy metabolism by increasing glucose use/transport and enhancing protein synthesis** [PMC 2553093](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2553093/). PKA can rapidly modulate synaptic efficacy and initiate protein synthesis-dependent growth processes.

**Rapid ocular dominance plasticity requires cortical but not geniculate protein synthesis**, demonstrating the necessity of local translation during critical period plasticity [Taha & Stryker, 2002](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2553093/).

While synaptogenesis starts prenatally, the increase in synapse numbers continues postnatally, with spine formation prominent in juvenile rodents during the critical period for ocular dominance plasticity [Hensch & Fagiolini, 2005](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn1787).

### Perineuronal Nets and Critical Period Closure

With age, PV cells are gradually enwrapped by perineuronal nets (PNNs), which both envelop synaptic boutons and create microenvironments in the extracellular milieu for factors such as Otx2 [PNAS 2020](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1820836117).

**Removal of PNNs or Otx2 in adulthood resets PV cells to a juvenile state, transiently enabling critical period plasticity anew.** Consequently, the brain may toggle between a plastic or nonplastic state to varying degree as a function of PNN/PV cell integrity across the life span.

### iPSC Cortical Neuron Maturation Timeline (D35-D65)

**The D35-D65 period represents a critical window for synaptogenesis and functional maturation in iPSC-derived cortical neurons** [Puppala et al., 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/mp201756).

**Key markers used to assess synaptogenesis include:** The expression of the presynaptic vesicle marker synapsin I increased during development. Synapsin I was diffused in axons and around cell bodies in early cultures, then aggregated along the mature dendrites in late cultures at day 71, suggesting its concentration at synaptic sites with the progress of neuronal development through synaptogenesis [PMC 8758945](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8758945/).

**Temporal Expression Patterns:**
- Genes immediately upregulated at day 10 (group UP1) were typically related to axogenesis, neuronal projection, and the formation and trafficking of presynaptic vesicles
- Genes upregulated after day 32 (group UP2) were involved in the regulation of transmembrane ion transport and mature synaptic functions including learning or memory, cognition, synaptic plasticity, and long-term potentiation
[PMC 10073939](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10073939/)

**D35 Timepoint Markers:**
- Neurons derived from iPSCs showed increased densities of presynaptic (SYN1) and postsynaptic (PSD95) markers at day 65
- Colocalization of SHANK and the excitatory marker PSD95 first detectable at 30 days after neural stem cell differentiation [Puppala et al., 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/mp201756)
- Most groups of genes involved in postsynaptic processes become enriched in human-induced neurons at day 35, indicating this is a critical maturation milestone [Marchetto et al., 2019](https://elifesciences.org/articles/59323)
- At D35, mature neuron markers like neurofilament heavy chain (NEFH) and syntaxin-1A (STX1A) are being expressed [Nature 2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06984-8)

**D65 Timepoint Markers:**
- Neurons derived from both human embryonic stem cells and iPSCs showed increased densities of the presynaptic, postsynaptic and juxtaposed synaptic markers SYN1 and PSD95 at d65 [PMC 10073939](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10073939/)
- Cultures at day 56 expressed various layer-specific cortical markers including BRN2, TBR1, FOXP2, CUX1, and mature dendritic marker MAP2 [Puppala et al., 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/mp201756)

## Part XII: Excitatory-Inhibitory Balance and Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Epilepsy

### E/I Imbalance as a Core Mechanism

**Normal E/I balance is often shifted in epilepsy, resulting in neuronal network hyperexcitability and recurrent seizures** [Wiley Epilepsia 2023](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/epi.17651).

**Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders. Although many factors contribute to epileptogenesis, seizure generation is mostly linked to hyperexcitability due to alterations in excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance** [PMC 8303198](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8303198/).

**An imbalance between excitation and inhibition has been a longstanding proposed mechanism regarding seizure generation and epileptogenesis**, related to increased extracellular glutamate and/or reduction in GABA concentrations, leading to excitotoxicity, seizures, and cell death [Purnell et al., 2021](https://www.seizure-journal.com/article/S1059-1311(21)00216-8/fulltext).

**Epileptic seizures involve a cortical excitation-inhibition imbalance driven by dysfunctional interneurons that contribute to gamma oscillation generation** [NCBI Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK2510/).

### Role of Interneuron Dysfunction

**One theory proposes that a selective loss of interneurons decreases the normal feed-forward and feedback inhibition of the dentate granule cells, an important group of principal neurons** [NCBI Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK2510/).

**The death or dysfunction of GABAergic interneurons in epileptogenic regions of the brain intensifies local disinhibition and facilitates the spread of seizure activity** [PMC 6406372](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6406372/).

Mutation of the gene for the transcription factor Aristaless-related homeobox protein (ARX) leads to impaired inhibitory interneuron migration from the forebrain ganglionic eminences to the neocortex, resulting in hyperexcitability and propensity to seizures such as infantile spasms.

### GABA/Glutamate Balance and Protein Synthesis Requirements

**GABA, the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter in the cerebral cortex, maintains the inhibitory tone that counterbalances neuronal excitation; when this balance is perturbed, seizures may ensue** [Treiman, 2001](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11520315/). GAD65 and GAD67 are two enzymes responsible for GABA synthesis; these enzymes are often downregulated in individuals with epilepsy, resulting in diminished GABA availability.

**GABA is synthesized in the cytoplasm of the presynaptic neuron from the precursor glutamate by the enzyme glutamate decarboxylase (GAD), which uses vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) as a cofactor** [Möhler, 2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK513311/).

**Protein Synthesis Requirements for Neurotransmitter Receptors:**
- Glutamate receptor mRNAs (NMDAR1, AMPA receptors) can be translated in isolated dendrites [Steward & Schuman, 2001](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.97.21.11545)
- The insertion of locally synthesized receptors into silent synapses may confer AMPA responsiveness
- The mRNA for GABA-A receptors has been found in dendrites

**In the DRP1 mutation context with downregulated ribosome pathways, insufficient local translation of GABA receptors and glutamate receptors could directly contribute to excitatory-inhibitory imbalance and seizure susceptibility.**

### Mitochondrial Dysfunction Mechanisms in Epilepsy

**Mitochondrial diseases are a heterogeneous group of diseases resulting from energy deficit and reduced adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production due to impaired oxidative phosphorylation. The manifestation of mitochondrial disease is usually multi-organ. Epilepsy is one of the most common manifestations of diseases resulting from mitochondrial dysfunction, especially in children** [PMC 8303198](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8303198/).

**ATP deficit suppresses the effect of intermediate inhibitory neurons in the hippocampus, facilitating the spread of excitation in the neuronal network. Lack of ATP molecules also results in the reduced potential of GABA-ergic inhibitory neurons, which leads to an impaired balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurons and excessive cell excitation.**

**High concentrations of ROS can oxidize mitochondrial proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, cause cell dysfunction, damage the ability of cells to maintain energy levels, cause energy exhaustion, damage and death of neurons, and change the excitability of neurons, thus reducing the threshold of seizures.** The imbalance of calcium homeostasis caused by mitochondrial dysfunction can increase the excitability of neurons and induce seizures.

**Hypotheses link mitochondrial failure to seizure generation through:**
1. Changes in calcium homeostasis
2. Oxidation of ion channels and neurotransmitter transporters by reactive oxygen species
3. Decrease in neuronal plasma membrane potential
4. Reduced network inhibition due to interneuronal dysfunction
[Rahman, 2015](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(15)00148-9/abstract)

**As neurons are terminally differentiated cells that lack significant regenerative capacity and have high energy demand, they are more vulnerable to mitochondrial dysfunction** [Zsurka & Kunz, 2015](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9656379/). Seizures, irrespective of their origin, represent excessive acute energy demand in the brain, and secondary mitochondrial dysfunction has been described in various epileptic disorders.

**Defective mitochondrial metabolism leads to excessive cell excitation through diverse mechanisms:**
1. Lowering of GABA-mediated inhibition from death of inhibitory interneurons
2. Suppression of hippocampal intermediate inhibitory neurons activity
3. Increasing glutamate release in the synaptic space by astrocytes
[Zsurka & Kunz, 2015](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9656379/)

### Excitotoxicity and Mitochondrial Feedback

**Excitotoxicity also affects the mitochondria function, since excessive glutamate disrupts Ca2+ balance and ATP production and further leads to the formation of reactive oxygen species** [OAText Excitotoxicity](https://www.oatext.com/excitotoxicity-as-a-molecular-mechanism-in-epilepsy.php).

**The elevated glutamate levels or mutations in metabolic receptors (e.g., AMPA, NMDA) can prolong the activation time of glutamatergic receptors, increase excitatory postsynaptic potential, lead to excitotoxicity, and trigger downstream apoptotic cascades** [Frontiers Epilepsy](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neurology/articles/10.3389/fneur.2024.1499876/full).

Excessive activation of NMDA and AMPA receptors can cause a sharp influx of sodium and calcium ions. Excessive calcium influx leads to calcium overload in the mitochondrial matrix, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction.

### Neuroinflammation and Oxidative Stress

**Metabolic dysfunction, excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) imbalance, and neurodegeneration can all result from these oxidative and inflammatory processes which ultimately contribute to epileptogenesis** [Frontiers Cell Dev Bio 2022](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cell-and-developmental-biology/articles/10.3389/fcell.2022.976953/full).

NF-KB activation leads to the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, TNFα, and IL-6, which have been shown to induce gliosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and glutathione (GSH) depletion.

## Part XIII: SynGO Database: Synaptic Ribosome Annotations

### SynGO Overview

**SynGO is an evidence-based, expert-curated knowledge base for the synapse that uses Gene Ontology (GO) annotations to describe 87 synaptic locations and 179 synaptic processes** [Koopmans et al., 2019](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6764089/). Established in 2019, SynGO 1.0 releases 2,922 ontology-based descriptions of 1,112 unique synaptic genes, compiling published experimental information about localization and function of gene products at synapses.

### Ribosome Annotations in SynGO

**An important finding from research using SynGO relates to postsynaptic ribosomes**: one set of SynGO genes, the postsynaptic ribosome genes, was not significant when compared to all other genes but became significant when conditioned on brain-expressed genes [Koopmans et al., 2019](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6764089/). This suggests that **protein synthesis machinery is an important component of postsynaptic compartments**.

Recent research has confirmed that over 75% of both excitatory and inhibitory presynaptic terminals contain the machinery for protein synthesis (rRNA, ribosomes, polyadenylated mRNA), and there is notably high ongoing protein synthesis in both pre- and postsynaptic compartments [Hafner et al., 2019](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.aau3644).

**The finding of downregulated presynaptic and postsynaptic ribosome pathways (from SynGO enrichment analysis) in maturation-specific contrasts (D35→D65) is therefore highly significant**, indicating disruption of a fundamental synaptic maturation process during the critical period in DRP1 mutant neurons.

## Part XIV: Integrated Mechanistic Model

### The Energy-Translation Crisis Cascade

Based on the comprehensive literature review, the following mechanistic cascade emerges:

**1. Primary Defect: DRP1 Mutations → Mitochondrial Hyperfusion**
- G32A and R403C dominant-negative mutations stall fission events
- Mitochondria become hyperfused with aberrant cristae structure
- Mitochondrial membrane potential becomes hyperpolarized
- Coupling efficiency decreases, with increased proton leak

**2. Mitochondrial Mispositioning → Local Synaptic ATP Depletion**
- Hyperfused mitochondria fail to traffic properly to synaptic terminals
- Stationary mitochondria cannot be maintained at pre- and postsynaptic sites
- ATP diffusion is limited in neuronal processes (~10-20 μm compartments)
- Result: Spatially confined ATP depletion at synapses despite adequate global ATP

**3. Mitochondrial Compensation Response (Upregulation)**
- Cells detect impaired OXPHOS coupling efficiency
- Upregulate 4 core pathways: mitochondrial ribosome, mitoribosome assembly, mtDNA maintenance, OXPHOS
- Attempt to increase mitochondrial translation capacity
- Glycolysis upregulation as metabolic adaptation

**4. Paradoxical Ribosome Downregulation**
- Local ATP deficit at synapses cannot support translation (4 ATP per peptide bond)
- Ribosome Assembly Stress Response (RASTR) activated
- Cytoplasmic ribosome biogenesis continues but ribosomes cannot function
- SynGO presynaptic and postsynaptic ribosome pathways specifically downregulated
- Translation initiation and elongation factors impaired

**5. Failed Local Protein Synthesis During Critical Period (D35-D65)**
- 75% of presynaptic terminals normally contain active ribosomes
- 60% of dendritic spines normally show active translation
- In DRP1 mutants: insufficient synthesis of synaptic proteins including:
  * Presynaptic: Synaptic vesicle proteins, neurotransmitter synthesis enzymes (GAD65/67), mitochondrial proteins (via Rab7a+ endosome-tethered ribosomes)
  * Postsynaptic: AMPA receptors, NMDA receptors, GABA-A receptors, PSD scaffolds (PSD-95, SHANK), calcium channels and regulatory proteins
- Result: Failed synapse maturation and reduced synaptic colocalization (super-resolution microscopy findings)

**6. Calcium Dysregulation Amplifies the Crisis**
- NNAT upregulation (most significant DEG at D35) → ER calcium overload via SERCA2 inhibition
- CACNG3 downregulation (>2-fold at D65) → loss of AMPA receptor modulation
- STIM/ORAI dysregulation → aberrant store-operated calcium entry
- Disrupted MAM function → impaired ER-mitochondria calcium transfer
- Inappropriate expression of RYR1/ATP2A1 (muscle-type calcium handling)
- Result: Higher calcium amplitude, faster time-to-peak, slower clearance (observed in mutants)

**7. Excitatory-Inhibitory Imbalance**
- Insufficient GABA-A receptor synthesis at inhibitory synapses
- Reduced GAD65/67 synthesis → decreased GABA production
- ATP deficit suppresses inhibitory interneuron function
- Enhanced AMPA receptor activity (loss of CACNG3 inhibition)
- Calcium dysregulation increases neuronal excitability
- Result: Network hyperexcitability

**8. Clinical Manifestation: Epileptic Encephalopathy**
- Refractory seizures and status epilepticus
- Developmental delay and regression
- Failed critical period plasticity
- Progressive neurodegeneration from chronic excitotoxicity

## Part XV: Key Mechanistic Questions

1. **What is the transcriptional regulatory mechanism causing ribosome gene downregulation?**
   - Examine expression of transcription factors regulating ribosomal RNA synthesis (e.g., MYC, mTOR targets)
   - Check for ribosome stress response activation (ZNF622, ATF4, p53)
   - What transcription factors mediate the specific downregulation of synaptic ribosome pathways?
   - Role of ATF4 and integrated stress response in this context?

2. **Is ribosome downregulation a cell-autonomous response to energy deficit, or a programmed developmental arrest?**
   - Compare ribosome expression in energy-depleted neurons (e.g., OXPHOS inhibitor treatment) vs DRP1 mutants
   - Test whether ATP supplementation or enhancing mitochondrial biogenesis rescues ribosome expression

3. **Why are BOTH presynaptic and postsynaptic ribosomes affected?**
   - Could reflect common energy dependence (both require local ATP)
   - Or could indicate trans-synaptic signaling (e.g., failed postsynaptic maturation signals back to presynaptic terminal)

4. **Spatial Specificity of ATP Depletion**
   - How precisely localized is the ATP deficit (~10-20 μm compartments)?
   - Can this be measured directly in DRP1 mutant neurons using genetically encoded ATP sensors?
   - Does ATP depletion occur equally at pre- and postsynaptic compartments?

5. **Ribosome Paradox Resolution**
   - Why does ribosome biogenesis remain upregulated if translation is failing?
   - Is this a failure of feedback signaling or a stress-response override?
   - Do unassembled ribosomal proteins accumulate and trigger proteotoxic stress?

6. **Is there a therapeutic window during the critical period (D35-D65)?**
   - Early intervention to enhance mitochondrial function or protein synthesis may prevent synaptic maturation failure
   - Late intervention after D65 may face consolidated network dysfunction
   - Can early intervention (before D65) rescue synaptic maturation?
   - Would enhancing mitochondrial fission pharmacologically prevent the phenotype?
   - Can energy supplementation or translation enhancement strategies work?

7. **Which comes first: calcium dysregulation or ribosome downregulation?**
   - NNAT is massively upregulated at D35 (early calcium defect)
   - Ribosome pathways show maturation-specific effects (D35→D65)
   - Suggests calcium defects may precede/cause translation defects

8. **Mutation-Specific Effects**
   - Why does R403C show broader compensation (100 vs 74 pathways) than G32A?
   - Do GTPase domain (G32A) vs stalk domain (R403C) mutations differentially affect mitochondrial trafficking vs fission?
   - Are there mutation-specific therapeutic vulnerabilities?

## Part XVI: Critical Gaps in Current Literature

1. **Direct measurements of local ATP at synapses in DRP1 mutant neurons** - While spatial ATP compartmentalization has been demonstrated (2025 bioRxiv), this has not been measured in DRP1 mutation context.

2. **Time-course of ribosome downregulation vs calcium dysregulation** - The temporal relationship between NNAT upregulation (D35) and ribosome pathway downregulation (D35→D65) needs elucidation.

3. **Cell-type specific effects** - Do inhibitory interneurons show greater vulnerability due to higher energy demands for GABA synthesis?

4. **MAM integrity in DRP1 mutants** - Direct measurement of ER-mitochondria contact sites and calcium transfer efficiency.

5. **Reversibility studies** - Can the synaptic phenotype be rescued by restoring mitochondrial positioning or enhancing local ATP production after D65?

## Part XVII: Visualization Plans

These visualizations are designed to test specific hypotheses and expose biological mechanisms from the transcriptomic data.

### 1. Synaptic Ribosome Gene Expression Heatmap (Pre vs Post)

**Purpose:** Directly visualize the downregulation of presynaptic vs postsynaptic ribosome pathway genes across conditions and timepoints. Will reveal whether pre- and postsynaptic ribosome downregulation share common regulatory mechanisms or are independently disrupted, and whether G32A vs R403C show domain-specific effects.

### 2. Mitochondrial-Translation Gene Network Diagram

**Purpose:** Expose coordinated downregulation of mitochondrial-translation axis and identify potential regulatory hubs (e.g., mTOR, CaMKII) that link energy metabolism to translation control. Include pre- vs postsynaptic compartment-specific genes.

### 3. Calcium Gene Expression Trajectory Plot (D35→D65)

**Purpose:** Visualize developmental trajectory of calcium handling genes and identify aberrant maturation patterns. Reveal whether calcium gene dysregulation is an early event (D35) or progressive (D35→D65), and whether there's a compensatory trajectory vs sustained dysfunction.

### 4. ATP-Ribosome Coupling Scatterplot

**Purpose:** Test the hypothesis that mitochondrial ATP production genes correlate with ribosomal gene expression. Test whether ATP production capacity predicts ribosome expression levels, and whether this coupling is disrupted in DRP1 mutants, supporting the energy-translation crisis model. Generate separate plots for presynaptic vs postsynaptic ribosome genes.

### 5. Synaptic Maturation Gene Module Heatmap

**Purpose:** Show how different synaptic gene modules fail to mature properly in DRP1 mutants. Reveal whether ribosome downregulation is part of broader synaptic maturation failure or is a specific early defect that cascades to other synaptic processes. Highlight ribosome-related pathways.

### 6. Excitatory-Inhibitory Balance Gene Panel

**Purpose:** Show expression of genes critical for E/I balance and connect to seizure phenotype. Quantify the molecular basis for excitatory-inhibitory imbalance and predict which neurotransmitter systems are most disrupted in each mutation.

## Conclusion

The literature comprehensively supports a model where **DRP1 mutations create a spatial energy-translation crisis at synapses during the critical developmental window**. The paradoxical upregulation of mitochondrial ribosome pathways alongside downregulation of cytoplasmic synaptic ribosomes represents a failed compensatory response: cells attempt to increase mitochondrial OXPHOS capacity, but hyperfused mitochondria cannot reach synaptic sites to deliver ATP. Without sufficient local ATP (4 ATP/peptide bond), synaptic ribosomes cannot function, local protein synthesis fails, synapses do not mature properly, and excitatory-inhibitory imbalance emerges, manifesting as epileptic encephalopathy. This mechanism connects mitochondrial dynamics, energy metabolism, protein synthesis, and synaptic function in a developmentally-specific pathological cascade.
