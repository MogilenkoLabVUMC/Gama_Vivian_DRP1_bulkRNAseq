# Biological Research: DRP1 Mutations, Synaptic Ribosome Downregulation, and the Energy-Translation Crisis in Cortical Neuron Development

## Executive Summary

This literature review examines the mechanistic connections between DRP1 (DNM1L) loss-of-function mutations, mitochondrial hyperfusion, local synaptic energy deficits, ribosome downregulation, and epileptic encephalopathy. The central finding is that **mitochondrial mispositioning creates spatially-confined ATP depletion at synapses, triggering a paradoxical ribosome downregulation despite upregulated ribosome biogenesis**, leading to failed synaptogenesis during the critical developmental window (D35-D65) in hiPSC-derived cortical neurons. This energy-translation crisis manifests clinically as refractory seizures and severe neurodevelopmental delay.

## Part I: DRP1 Mutations and Clinical Phenotype

### DNM1L-Related Epileptic Encephalopathy

De novo heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in DNM1L present in the first year of life with devastating neurodevelopmental phenotypes including severe epileptic encephalopathy, developmental delay, optic atrophy, and refractory seizures [Vanstone et al., 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5100740/). The most common clinical features include global developmental delay (12/13 cases), refractory seizures and status epilepticus (8/13), hypotonia, and respiratory distress [Vanstone et al., 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5100740/).

**DNM1L encodes dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1/DLP1), a key component of the mitochondrial fission machinery that is essential to proper functioning of the mammalian brain** [PubMed 27145208](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27145208/). Autosomal dominant and recessive variants in DNM1L cause encephalopathy due to defective mitochondrial and peroxisomal fission 1 (EMPF1), which presents as a complex and clinically heterogeneous neurological disorder of variable severity, often accompanied by seizures [PubMed 27145208](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27145208/).

### Dominant-Negative Mechanisms of G32A and R403C Mutations

**Both G32A (GTPase domain) and R403C (stalk domain) act as dominant-negative mutations** that disrupt DRP1 oligomerization and recruitment to mitochondria [Vanstone et al., 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5100740/). The R403C mutation reduces oligomerization, mitochondrial fission activity, and mitochondrial recruitment of DRP1, but to a lesser extent compared to other mutations like A395D [PubMed 36763487](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36763487/).

**Critical mechanistic insight: EMPF1-associated mutations do not appear to alter the capacity of DRP1 to be recruited to points of fission, but rather cause stalling of the fission events** [PubMed 36763487](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36763487/). This explains why hyperfused mitochondria accumulate but fission machinery is still recruited to constriction sites.

### Synaptic Maturation Defects in Patient Neurons (2024)

**Recent research reveals mutation-specific effects on synaptic development**: High-resolution time-lapse imaging of axonal transport in mutant DRP1 cortical neurons reveals mutation-specific changes in mitochondrial motility of severely hyperfused mitochondrial structures [Khanal et al., 2024](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11370610/). Transcriptional profiling of mutant DRP1 cortical neurons during maturation also implicates mutation-dependent alterations in synaptic development and calcium regulation gene expression [Khanal et al., 2024](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11370610/).

**Deficits in pre- and post-synaptic marker colocalization using super-resolution microscopy strongly suggest that altered mitochondrial morphology of DRP1 mutant neurons leads to pathogenic dysregulation of synaptic development and activity** [Khanal et al., 2024](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11370610/).

RNA-seq results reveal differences in gene expression between DRP1 mutant cultures, supporting a possible structure-function relationship between mutations in specific DRP1 domains and downstream patient phenotypes [Khanal et al., 2024](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11370610/). Notable differences include significantly decreased expression of PCDHGC3 (neural cadherin-like cell adhesion protein) and PNPO (enzyme required for B6 and neurotransmitter synthesis) [Khanal et al., 2024](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11370610/).

### Phenotype-Genotype Correlations

The clinical phenotype of DNM1L mutations depends on the degree of mitochondrial fission deficiency, ranging from severe encephalopathy and death shortly after birth to initially normal development and then sudden onset of refractory status epilepticus with very poor neurologic outcome [PubMed 30939602](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30939602/).

**2025 case reports continue to document the severity**: Structural modeling of p.(Gly401Ser) predicted the interference of the mutant protein in the self-oligomerization of the DRP1 active complex [PubMed 39859560](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39859560/). DNM1L-related phenotypes include static or (early) lethal encephalopathy and neurodevelopmental disorders, with ophthalmological impairment, peripheral neuropathy, ataxia, dystonia, spasticity, myoclonus, and myopathy [PubMed 39859560](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39859560/). Few pathogenic variants, including p.(Gly401Ser), cause an encephalocardiomyopathy with refractory status epilepticus [PubMed 39859560](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39859560/).

## Part II: Mitochondrial Hyperfusion and Bioenergetic Consequences

### Mitochondrial Membrane Hyperpolarization and Cristae Defects

**The inability of DRP1 to fragment mitochondria in patient-derived fibroblasts not only leads to the hyperfusion phenotype but also to delayed cell death in response to apoptotic signals, aberrant mitochondrial cristae structure and hyperpolarized mitochondrial membrane potential** [DRP1 mutations EMPF1](https://journals.biologists.com/jcs/article/136/3/jcs260370/286985/DRP1-mutations-associated-with-EMPF1).

**Mitochondrial hyperfusion results in aberrant cristae structure and hyperpolarized mitochondrial membrane potential, both of which are tightly linked to changes in metabolism** [DRP1 mutations EMPF1](https://journals.biologists.com/jcs/article/136/3/jcs260370/286985/DRP1-mutations-associated-with-EMPF1). Pausing peroxisomal and mitochondrial fission results in alterations of cristae structure, changes in mitochondrial membrane potential, decreased mitochondrial coupling efficiency, delayed cell death response, and overall metabolic adaptations [DRP1 mutations EMPF1](https://journals.biologists.com/jcs/article/136/3/jcs260370/286985/DRP1-mutations-associated-with-EMPF1).

### Coupling Efficiency and ATP Production

**Metabolically, the changes in mitochondrial and peroxisomal morphology result in inefficiency of ETC coupling oxygen consumption with ATP production, upregulation of glycolysis and overall metabolic reprogramming** [DRP1 mutations EMPF1](https://journals.biologists.com/jcs/article/136/3/jcs260370/286985/DRP1-mutations-associated-with-EMPF1). In addition to elongated mitochondrial morphology and lack of fission, patient cells display lower coupling efficiency, increased proton leak and upregulation of glycolysis [PubMed 36763487](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36763487/).

Inhibition of mitochondrial fission through Drp1 modulation impairs mitochondrial function: HeLa cells with reduced Drp1 expression showed decreased complex IV activity and a decrease in both state 3 respiration (maximal ATP synthesis rates) and state 4 respiration [PMC 5297777](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5297777/).

### Cristae Junction Regulation of Membrane Potential

**The crista junction (CJ) serves as an important barrier separating the cristae (CM) and inner boundary membranes (IBM), thereby regulating the movement of ions and ensuring distinct electrical potentials across the cristae (ΔΨC) and inner boundary (ΔΨIBM) membranes** [Scientific Reports](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-65595-z). Dynamic multi-parameter correlation measurements of spatial mitochondrial membrane potential gradients, ATP levels, and mitochondrial morphometrics revealed a CJ-based membrane potential overflow valve mechanism protecting mitochondrial integrity during excessive cristae hyperpolarization [Scientific Reports](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-65595-z).

## Part III: Mitochondrial Positioning and Local ATP Supply at Synapses

### The Critical Role of Mitochondrial Positioning

**ATP has a limited diffusion capacity in the intracellular environment, particularly within long neuronal processes. Stationary mitochondria are needed to provide local sources of ATP, which is necessary to maintain the activity of Na+/K+ ATPases, as well as fast spike propagation and synaptic transmission** [PMC 4962561](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4962561/).

Approximately two-thirds of the mitochondrial population are stationary in mature neurons. These immobilized mitochondria either have dissociated from transport motors or are anchored to the cytoskeleton [PMC 4962561](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4962561/). Syntaphilin was identified as a "static anchor" for axonal mitochondria [PMC 4962561](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4962561/).

### Mitochondria Support Local Protein Synthesis

**Mitochondria are involved in local protein synthesis, protein transport, and Ca2+ buffering critical for synapse maintenance and structural dynamics** [eLife 89682](https://elifesciences.org/articles/89682). **Experiments have shown that oxidative phosphorylation by mitochondria is needed for dendritic protein translation, not glycolysis, and that it contributes a majority of the energy consumed at the postsynaptic site by receptor and ion channel activation** [eLife 89682](https://elifesciences.org/articles/89682).

Transcriptomic studies suggested that a large portion of proteins present in dendrites and at dendritic spines can be synthesized locally based on mRNA specifically transported to this compartment, revealing a previously unappreciated enormous potential for the local protein synthesis machinery to supply, maintain, and modify the dendritic and synaptic proteome [eLife 89682](https://elifesciences.org/articles/89682).

### Activity-Dependent Mitochondrial Recruitment

**Neuronal activity drives ATP generation, confirming that OXPHOS is the major source of energy during neuronal activity and synaptic transmission to support spine growth, cytoskeletal rearrangements and protein synthesis** [Cell Mol Life Sci](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00018-023-04814-8). **Increasing synaptic activity decreases the motion of dendritic mitochondria and enhances their localization at synapses. During postsynaptic depolarization, dendritic mitochondria become clustered at the base of spines and protrude into them** [Cell Mol Life Sci](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00018-023-04814-8). Activation of glutamate receptors with exogenous or synaptically released glutamate recruits mitochondria to synapses [Cell Mol Life Sci](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00018-023-04814-8).

### Spatial Compartmentalization of ATP for Plasticity (2025)

**Critical 2025 discovery**: Supplying energy to distant synapses is challenging as they are distributed throughout dendrites and axons, spanning hundreds of microns from their cell body. Synapses require an instant and local energy supply provided by mitochondria stabilized near dendritic spines [bioRxiv 2025](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.09.648032v1.full). Using highly sensitive spine- and mitochondrial ATP reporters, researchers found that **synaptic plasticity input drives instant and sustained increase in spine ATP levels, provided by local ATP synthesis in ~10-20 μm spatially confined compartments within mitochondria** [bioRxiv 2025](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.09.648032v1.full).

**Probing single molecules reveals that mitochondrial inner membrane proteins reorganize during synaptic plasticity in dendritic spines of engram cells**: Using 3D MINFLUX nanoscopy, researchers identified a significant redistribution of α-F1-ATP synthase correlating with learning-related activities [Nature Comms Bio 2025](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-025-08963-3). This redistribution suggests a pivotal role for polarized ATP synthesis near the postsynaptic zone in modulating synaptic plasticity [Nature Comms Bio 2025](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-025-08963-3).

### Connection to Presynaptic Function

**The availability of presynaptic mitochondria at axonal release sites directly influences synaptic function** [eNeuro 2018](https://www.eneuro.org/content/5/1/ENEURO.0390-17.2018). **Local axonal protein synthesis has been shown to be required for the maintenance of mitochondrial function. It is very likely that local presynaptic signaling mechanisms regulate the expression of mitochondrial proteins in axons, thereby controlling mitochondrial ultrastructure and performance** [EMBO reports](https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/embr.201948882).

---

## Part IV: Synaptic Ribosomes and Local Protein Synthesis

### Ubiquitous Presence of Ribosomes at Synapses

**Landmark finding: Over 75% of both excitatory and inhibitory presynaptic terminals in the hippocampus and forebrain contain the machinery for protein synthesis: rRNA, ribosomes, and polyadenylated mRNA** [Hafner et al., 2019](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aau3644). In adult rodent brain slices and cultured neurons, both light microscopy and electron microscopy revealed that in the absence of overt stimulation, there was a notably high level of ongoing protein synthesis in both pre- and postsynaptic compartments [Hafner et al., 2019](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aau3644).

**After just 5 minutes of metabolic labeling, approximately 40% of both excitatory and inhibitory presynaptic terminals and ~60% of dendritic spines exhibited active translation** [Hafner et al., 2019](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aau3644).

### Presynaptic Ribosomes and Active Translation

Researchers have shown an essential ribosomal component, 5.8S rRNA, at a glutamatergic nerve terminal in the mammalian brain and demonstrated active translation in nerve terminals in situ in brain slices, showing ongoing presynaptic protein synthesis in the mammalian brain [eLife 36697](https://elifesciences.org/articles/36697).

**Shortly after inhibiting translation, the presynaptic terminal exhibits increased spontaneous release, an increased paired pulse ratio, an increased vesicle replenishment rate during stimulation trains, and a reduced initial probability of release** [eLife 36697](https://elifesciences.org/articles/36697). This suggests that ongoing protein synthesis can limit excessive vesicle release, conserving energy required for maintaining synaptic transmission [eLife 36697](https://elifesciences.org/articles/36697).

### Presynaptic FMRP and Structural Plasticity

The mouse hippocampal mossy fiber (MF)-CA3 synapse expresses both structural and functional presynaptic plasticity and contains presynaptic fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein (FMRP), an RNA-binding protein involved in postsynaptic protein-synthesis-dependent plasticity [PMC 9391299](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9391299/). MF boutons contain ribosomes and synthesize protein locally [PMC 9391299](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9391299/).

**Long-term potentiation of MF-CA3 synaptic transmission (MF-LTP) was associated with translation-dependent enlargement of MF boutons** [PMC 9391299](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9391299/). Increasing in vitro or in vivo MF activity enhanced protein synthesis in MFs, and deletion of presynaptic FMRP blocked structural and functional MF-LTP [PMC 9391299](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9391299/).

### mRNA Localization to Synaptic Compartments

**mRNA translation is regulated locally in neuronal dendrites, axons, dendritic spines, presynaptic boutons, or axonal growth cones** [Frontiers Mol Neuro](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/molecular-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2022.823135/full). **Variability in local protein synthesis is critical for neuronal development, maintenance, synaptic signaling, and plasticity. Disruptions of activity-induced local translation have drastic consequences leading to cognitive deficits observed in several neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases** [Frontiers Mol Neuro](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/molecular-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2022.823135/full).

## Part V: Energy Cost of Translation and the ATP-Ribosome Coupling

### The 4 ATP Equivalents Per Peptide Bond

**The main energetic cost in cells is peptide bond formation at the ribosome. It consumes 4 ATP equivalents per peptide bond formed** [PMC 2632092](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2632092/). **The high cost of protein synthesis comes from 4 ATP equivalents expended per peptide bond synthesized at the ribosome: the PPi-producing step at aminoacyl-tRNA synthesis (counted as two ATP equivalents) and the two GTP-consuming steps at translation** [PMC 7616719](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7616719/).

**Breakdown:**
1. **Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthesis (2 ATP equivalents):** AARSs activate the amino acids to aminoacyl-adenylates by transferring an AMP residue from ATP to the corresponding amino acid with the concurrent release of PPi, then transferring the aminoacyl moiety to the corresponding tRNA molecule [Biology Stack Exchange](https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/40964/how-much-nucleoside-triphosphate-is-required-to-form-one-peptide-bond-during-pro). The two-step AARS reaction generates AMP and PPi, whereby PPi is immediately hydrolyzed to two Pi by ubiquitous pyrophosphatases, making the process irreversible [Biology Stack Exchange](https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/40964/how-much-nucleoside-triphosphate-is-required-to-form-one-peptide-bond-during-pro).

2. **Ribosome Translation (2 GTP):** The cost and energy currency of elongation and translocation at the ribosome is two GTP per peptide bond formed [PMC 7616719](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7616719/). The energetic cost of translation is incurred at the elongation and translocation phase, which require two further GTPases, the elongation factors EF-Tu and EF-G [PMC 7616719](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7616719/).

### Cellular Energy Budget for Translation

**Broken down across the total ATP pool, roughly 34% of the E. coli energy budget is expended for irreversible reactions (mostly to make translation irreversible), roughly 38% is expended for biosynthesis, while 27% of the E. coli energy budget is converted to GTP for translation** [BNID 107782](https://bionumbers.hms.harvard.edu/bionumber.aspx?s=n&v=0&id=107782).

**Most cellular ATP is utilized in protein synthesis via tRNA aminoacylation and GTP regeneration** [PMC 5500012](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5500012/).

### Additional Costs: Error Correction and Quality Control

The addition of an amino acid to a growing peptide chain requires two ATP molecules for amino acid activation and another two ATP for peptide bond formation and ribosome translation, plus additional costs of about another ATP for error correction and the synthesis of sequences that are removed during protein maturation [NCBI Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK224633/).

Certain amino acids (e.g., val and ile) are sufficiently similar to one another that the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases have evolved a proofreading capacity, in which any incorrectly aminoacylated tRNA is hydrolyzed [Protein Synthesis Maturation](http://www2.csudh.edu/nsturm/CHEMXL153/ProteinSynthesisMaturation.htm).

## Part VI: Ribosome Biogenesis Stress Responses and the Translation Paradox

### The Ribosome Assembly Stress Response (RASTR)

**Under various stress conditions (including RASTR, heat shock, TORC1 inhibition), levels of unassembled ribosomal proteins (RPs) increase dramatically, and RPs accumulate with nucleolar proteins, Ifh1 and chaperones in an insoluble nuclear or nucleolar fraction** [eLife 45002](https://elifesciences.org/articles/45002). This leads to the rapid upregulation of Hsf1 target genes (e.g., chaperones and proteasome components), presumably through Hsp70 titration, and to the coincident downregulation of RP genes through Ifh1 sequestration [eLife 45002](https://elifesciences.org/articles/45002).

**Given the extremely high level of ribosomal protein (RP) synthesis in rapidly growing cells, alteration of any step in the ribosome assembly process may impact growth by leading to proteotoxic stress** [eLife 45002](https://elifesciences.org/articles/45002). Top1 depletion triggered a rapid response at two specific groups of genes: upregulation of Hsf1 target genes and downregulation of RP genes [eLife 45002](https://elifesciences.org/articles/45002).

### The Ribosome Biogenesis Stress Response (RiBiSR)

**In response to stress, the integrated stress response (ISR) rapidly inhibits global translation. Stress specifically inhibits the first step of rRNA processing** [bioRxiv 2020](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.16.250183v1.full). **Unprocessed rRNA is stored within the nucleolus, and when stress resolves, it re-enters the ribosome biogenesis pathway** [bioRxiv 2020](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.16.250183v1.full). Retention of unprocessed rRNA within the nucleolus aids in the maintenance of this organelle [bioRxiv 2020](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.16.250183v1.full).

This response is independent of the ISR or inhibition of cellular translation but represents an independent stress-response pathway termed Ribosome Biogenesis Stress Response (RiBiSR) [bioRxiv 2020](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.16.250183v1.full).

### Translation Stress Paradox

**In the case of dysfunctional mRNA translation, stress signals from polysomes activate PI3Kδ and trigger a novel signaling pathway independent of AKT and mTOR, resulting in increased translation of E2F1 mRNA** [MDPI translation stress](https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/19/12/3757). The newly synthesized active E2F1, in turn, stimulates the downstream transcription targets c-Myc and cyclins to induce ribosome biogenesis and cell proliferation [MDPI translation stress](https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/19/12/3757).

### Ribosome Hibernation During Energy Stress

**Cell survival under nutrient-deprived conditions relies on cells' ability to adapt their organelles and rewire their metabolic pathways. In yeast, glucose depletion induces a stress response mediated by mitochondrial fragmentation and sequestration of cytosolic ribosomes on mitochondria** [Nature Comms 2024](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-52911-4).

Biochemical analyses suggest a halt of protein synthesis by day 4 of glucose depletion, manifested by a decline in polysome amounts and an accumulation of 80S monosomes [Nature Comms 2024](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-52911-4). Cryo-EM structural analysis of cytosolic ribosomes isolated from glucose-depleted cells reveals an inactive ribosomal state lacking both tRNA and mRNA [Nature Comms 2024](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-52911-4). The inactive ribosomes also exhibit conformational changes in the peptidyl transferase center, disrupting the inter-subunit bridge B2a which is integral for translation [Nature Comms 2024](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-52911-4).

### ATP-Mg²⁺-Ribosome Interplay

**Even though ATP powers virtually all energy-dependent activity, most cellular ATP is utilized in protein synthesis via tRNA aminoacylation and GTP regeneration. Magnesium (Mg²⁺), the most common divalent cation in living cells, plays crucial roles in protein synthesis by maintaining the structure of ribosomes, participating in the biochemistry of translation initiation and functioning as a counter-ion for ATP** [PMC 5500012](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5500012/).

Organisms cope with Mg²⁺ limitation by decreasing ATP levels and ribosome production, thereby reallocating Mg²⁺ to indispensable cellular processes [PMC 5500012](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5500012/). **Paradoxically, translational arrest leads to accumulation of ATP. Despite the large amount of ribosomes and high levels of energy in the cell, protein synthesis is suspended due to lack of free Mg²⁺, and cells stop growing** [PMC 4531837](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4531837/).

## Part VII: Mitochondrial Compensation: OXPHOS and Mitoribosome Upregulation

### OXPHOS Deficiency Triggers Adaptive Responses

**Yeast oxidative phosphorylation mutants deficient in complex III, IV, V, and mtDNA exhibit activated stress responses and progressive reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm)** [EMBO reports 2021](https://www.embopress.org/doi/abs/10.15252/embr.202051606). These mutants progressively activate adaptive responses, including transcriptional downregulation of ATP synthase inhibitor Inh1 and OXPHOS subunits, Puf3-mediated upregulation of import receptor Mia40 and global mitochondrial biogenesis, Snf1/AMPK-mediated upregulation of glycolysis and repression of ribosome biogenesis, and transcriptional upregulation of cytoplasmic chaperones [EMBO reports 2021](https://www.embopress.org/doi/abs/10.15252/embr.202051606).

**Gene ontology analysis showed that the three most downregulated biological processes in ρ0 cells all relate to ribosome biogenesis and mainly consist of transcripts encoding ribosome subunits and ribosome processing/assembly factors. The most-upregulated processes are mitochondrial translation, mitochondrial gene expression, and carbohydrate metabolic process (glucose transporters and glycolysis genes)** [EMBO reports 2021](https://www.embopress.org/doi/abs/10.15252/embr.202051606).

### Mitonuclear Translation Balance Disruption

**Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes consist of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA-encoded subunits. Their biogenesis requires cross-compartment gene regulation to mitigate the accumulation of disproportionate subunits** [Genome Biology 2022](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-022-02732-9).

**When mitochondrial gene expression is constitutively impaired, a compensatory reduction in nuclear OXPHOS expression does not occur**, suggesting that these cells lack active feedback mechanisms to maintain mitonuclear translational balance [Genome Biology 2022](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-022-02732-9). Ongoing cytosolic translation despite a repression of mitochondrial protein synthesis resulted in unbalanced translatomes, which lead to the upregulation of proteostasis genes [Genome Biology 2022](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-022-02732-9).

### Structural Evolution of Mitoribosomes and OXPHOS Complexes

**Mitoribosomes have evolved similarly to mitochondrial OXPHOS complexes via two distinct phases**: a constructive phase that mainly acted early in eukaryote evolution, resulting in the recruitment of approximately 75 novel subunits, and a reductive phase that acted during metazoan evolution, resulting in gradual length-reduction of mitochondrially encoded rRNAs and OXPHOS proteins [PMC 4453056](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4453056/).

**The main role of the newly recruited nuclear-encoded ribosomal and OXPHOS proteins is to provide structural compensation to the mutationally destabilized mitochondrially encoded components** [PMC 4453056](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4453056/).

### mtDNA Maintenance and Mitoribosome Assembly Coupling

**In cases of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion, which reduces 12S and 16S rRNA levels, mitoribosome assembly is halted due to insufficient rRNA substrates, preventing the formation of functional subunits and linking mtDNA maintenance to translational capacity** [PubMed 27023847](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27023847/).

**The binding of mitochondrial ribosomal protein L12 (MRPL12) directly to POLRMT may couple transcription and translation directly or provide a means to coordinate transcription of mtDNA-encoded rRNAs with the import of nucleus-encoded mitochondrial ribosomal proteins** [PubMed 27023847](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27023847/). This poses the interesting possibility that key aspects of mitochondrial ribosome assembly are monitored by cells, perhaps as a signal to determine the rate of overall mitochondrial biogenesis or as a metric of mitochondrial functional capacity [PubMed 27023847](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27023847/).

### Integrated Stress Response (ISR) in Mitochondrial Dysfunction

Studies have shown that the activation of the integrated stress response (ISR) is a hallmark of mitochondrial dysfunction and that the general retrograde signal is coordinated by ATF4 downstream of eIF2α phosphorylation [ScienceDirect ISR](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2468867322000736). A major study by Quirós et al. in HeLa cells demonstrated that ATF4 is responsible for the cytoprotective response that leads to transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolic adaptation [ScienceDirect ISR](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2468867322000736).

**Both genetic and pharmacological mitochondrial OxPhos defects trigger marked hypermetabolism in a cell-autonomous manner** [Nature Comms Bio 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-022-04303-x). mtDNA instability, activation of the ISR, increased secretory activity, and transcriptional upregulation of transcriptional/translational stress pathways have been identified as potential contributors to hypermetabolism [Nature Comms Bio 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-022-04303-x).

## Part VIII: Calcium Dysregulation in DRP1 Mutant Neurons

### NNAT (Neuronatin): ER Calcium Store Dysregulation

**Neuronatin is a small membrane protein localized predominantly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)** and exists in two isoforms (α and β having 81 and 54 amino acids respectively) [PMC 3173491](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3173491/). **Neuronatin is associated with SERCA2 in the hippocampus, and NNAT was co-immunoprecipitated from microsomes using SERCA2 antibody** [PMC 3173491](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3173491/).

**Neuronatin has been shown to trigger neural induction in embryonic stem cells through increasing intracellular Ca2+ by antagonizing sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA), and its abnormal function is associated with certain types of epilepsy** [PMC 3003906](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3003906/). **Overexpression of GFP/NNATβ occludes Ca2+ elevation by thapsigargin, suggesting that NNAT antagonizes SERCA pump activity** [PMC 3003906](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3003906/).

**Neuronatin (NNAT) is a developmentally regulated ER resident protein and negative regulator of SERCA that is expressed in the brain's PVALB+ GABAergic neurons; NNAT has also been implicated in abnormal neurodevelopment, including ASD and Angelman Syndrome (AS)** [Frontiers Mol Neuro](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/molecular-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00035/full). Coimmunoprecipitation results showed Nnat could interact with SERCA2 but not IP3R, and Nnat interacted with SERCA2 to mediate calcium transport processes [Frontiers Mol Neuro](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/molecular-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00035/full).

**In the context of your DRP1 mutation findings:** Aberrant miR-339-5p/neuronatin signaling causes prodromal neuronal calcium dyshomeostasis in mutant presenilin mice [PMC 9012292](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9012292/). Overexpression of NNAT recapitulates spine loss and ER calcium overload in cortical neurons with PSEN1 mutation [PMC 9012292](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9012292/).

### SERCA2 and Calcium Homeostasis

**Intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis greatly relies on the rapid redistribution of Ca2+ ions into diverse subcellular organelles including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Ca2+ released into the neuronal cytoplasm is pumped back into the ER by SERCA2, a P-type ion-motive ATPase that resides on the ER membrane** [PubMed 29663107](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29663107/).

**SERCA2-dependent Ca2+ dysregulation has been implicated in several disorders that affect cognitive function, including Darier's disease, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, and cerebral ischemia** [PubMed 29663107](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29663107/).

### CACNG3 and AMPA Receptor Modulation

**Genetic studies have identified a region within chromosome 22q13.1 containing the CACNG2 locus in families with epilepsy. CACNG2 and CACNG3, encoding voltage-dependent calcium channel γ-subunits 2 and 3, regulate glutamate signaling as TARPs, and AMPA receptor-TARP complexes are involved in long-term potentiation and depression** [Dovepress JRLCR](https://www.dovepress.com/the-ampa-receptor-as-a-therapeutic-target-in-epilepsy-preclinical-and--peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-JRLCR).

**Several human genetic analyses suggest that TARP pathology can underlie familial epilepsy syndromes. Linkage and mutational analysis studies have shown a link between childhood absence epilepsy and the CACNG3 (TARP γ-3) mutation** [Dovepress JRLCR](https://www.dovepress.com/the-ampa-receptor-as-a-therapeutic-target-in-epilepsy-preclinical-and--peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-JRLCR).

### Stargazin Model of Absence Epilepsy

Mutations in CACNG2 are implicated in the stargazer mouse model of absence epilepsy, where **defective stargazin leads to mistrafficking of AMPA receptors in fast-spiking parvalbumin-positive interneurons of the neocortex and reticular thalamic nucleus, resulting in network disinhibition and hyperexcitability** [PMC 3164835](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3164835/).

**Stargazer mice are characterized by ataxia and seizures, which resemble the human disorder absence epilepsy** [Journal of Neuroscience 2008](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/28/42/10599). Stargazin, the protein mutated in stargazer mice, promotes the expression and function of neuronal AMPA receptors (AMPARs) [Journal of Neuroscience 2008](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/28/42/10599). However, it is unclear how decreased expression of excitatory AMPARs generates stargazer seizures, given that seizures often result from increased neuronal excitability [Journal of Neuroscience 2008](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/28/42/10599).

**Decreased nRT neuron excitability caused by the loss of AMPARs may limit their participation within the thalamocortical network, and eventually lead to disinhibition and absence-like seizures** [Journal of Neuroscience 2008](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/28/42/10599).

### GAERS Model Findings

Absence-like seizures in the Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg (GAERS) model are believed to arise in hyperexcitable somatosensory cortical neurons [ScienceDirect GAERS](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0969996111000040). **Expression of the TARP stargazin is elevated in the somatosensory cortex of GAERS** [ScienceDirect GAERS](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0969996111000040). TARPs are critical regulators of the trafficking and function of AMPA receptors [ScienceDirect GAERS](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0969996111000040).

**Elevated stargazin in GAERS is associated with an increase in AMPA receptor proteins, GluA1 and GluA2, in the somatosensory cortex plasma membrane of adult epileptic GAERS** [ScienceDirect GAERS](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0969996111000040).

### Store-Operated Calcium Entry (SOCE): STIM and ORAI

**SOCE plays a critical role in many calcium-dependent processes in neurons and glial cells, influencing neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity. SOCE in neural cells is mediated by stromal interaction molecule proteins (STIM1 and STIM2), which function as ER calcium sensors, and Orai channels (Orai1, Orai2, Orai3) that form calcium-selective channels in the plasma membrane** [Frontiers Cell Neuro](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cellular-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fncel.2015.00153/full).

**The canonical pathway for SOCE involves the detection of reduced ER Ca²⁺ levels by STIM1, which rapidly translocates to endoplasmic reticulum-plasma membrane junctions where it directly activates ORAI1 Ca²⁺ channels, promoting the entry of Ca²⁺ into the cytoplasm** [J Physiol 2024](https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1113/JP283827). These Ca²⁺ ions are then pumped into the ER by sarcoendoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) pumps [J Physiol 2024](https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1113/JP283827).

### Role in Synaptic Plasticity

**Studies showed that SOCE refills endogenous Ca²⁺ stores, governs spontaneous neurotransmitter release, and regulates both short and long-term synaptic plasticity in central nervous system (CNS)** [Journal of Neuroscience 2015](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/35/40/13784). Earlier work ascribed a role for store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) also in synaptic plasticity, in that SOCE antagonists reduce long-term potentiation in hippocampus [Frontiers Syn Neuro](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/synaptic-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.573714/full).

**STIM1 is more mobile primarily in young neurons, while STIM2 is less mobile and more prominent in older neurons in culture** [Frontiers Syn Neuro](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/synaptic-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.573714/full). STIM1 mobility is associated with spontaneous calcium sparks, local transient rise in cytosolic [Ca²⁺]i, and in the formation and elongation of dendritic filopodia/spines [Frontiers Syn Neuro](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/synaptic-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.573714/full). In contrast, STIM2 is associated with older neurons, where it is mobile and moves into dendritic spines primarily when cytosolic [Ca²⁺]i levels are reduced [Frontiers Syn Neuro](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/synaptic-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.573714/full).

### Mitochondria-ER Contact Sites (MAMs) and Calcium Transfer

**Mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs) are direct contact sites between the ER and mitochondria that serve as platforms to coordinate fundamental cellular processes such as mitochondrial dynamics and bioenergetics, calcium and lipid homeostasis, autophagy, apoptosis, inflammation, and intracellular stress responses** [Frontiers Neuro 2021](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.715945/full).

**MERCs (mitochondria-ER contact sites) provide a direct avenue for calcium transfer from the ER to the mitochondria. Because the concentration of ER calcium is several orders of magnitude higher than cytosolic calcium, the existence of these contact sites can result in a direct conduit for increasing mitochondrial calcium concentration** [npj Sys Bio](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41540-021-00185-7).

**The calcium liberated by IP3Rs can be transported to the mitochondria via a mechanism similar to quasi-synaptic transfer. IP3Rs form an interaction link with voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs) located on the outer mitochondrial membrane. This interaction is facilitated by the molecular chaperone glucose-regulated protein 75 (Grp75), which forms an ER-mitochondrial tethering complex within the MAM** [SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-12457-1_29).

**In neurons, the interaction between ER and mitochondria in synapses has been postulated to shape intracellular Ca2+ signals and modulate synaptic and integrative neuronal activities** [npj Sys Bio](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41540-021-00185-7). **The MERC compartment, which is technically part of the cytosol, is enriched in calcium even though there is no physical membrane separating the two compartments. By serving as a direct conduit for Ca2+ influx from the cytosol, MERCs play an important role in localizing Ca2+ and thereby increasing ATP production locally at active synapses** [npj Sys Bio](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41540-021-00185-7).

## Part IX: Activity-Dependent Translation and CaMKII-mTOR Signaling

### CaMKII's Central Role in Synaptic Plasticity

**Calcium–calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) has a central role in synaptic plasticity, learning and memory** [Nature Rev Neuro 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-022-00624-2). It is activated by intracellular increases in calcium ion levels and triggers molecular processes necessary for synaptic plasticity [Nature Rev Neuro 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-022-00624-2). CaMKII phosphorylates numerous synaptic proteins, thereby regulating their structure and functions [Nature Rev Neuro 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-022-00624-2).

**LTP induction results in calcium entry, which activates CaMKII. CaMKII subsequently translocates to the synapse, where it binds to NMDA-type glutamate receptors and produces potentiation by phosphorylating principal and auxiliary subunits of AMPA-type glutamate receptors** [Nature Rev Neuro 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-022-00624-2). These processes are localized to stimulated spines and account for the synapse specificity of LTP [Nature Rev Neuro 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-022-00624-2). In the later stages of LTP, CaMKII has a structural role in enlarging and strengthening the synapse [Nature Rev Neuro 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-022-00624-2).

### mTORC1 and Translation Initiation

**The formation of long-term memories depends on de novo protein synthesis, a process tightly regulated by the mechanistic/mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway** [Wiley JNC 2025](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jnc.70281). **mTORC1 promotes mRNA translation initiation in the central nervous system, and research has uncovered that excitatory neurons, inhibitory neurons, and glia play distinct roles in modulating synaptic strength and encoding long-term memory via mTORC1 signaling** [Wiley JNC 2025](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jnc.70281).

**LTP induction is triggered by Ca²⁺ influx through activated NMDARs, which then stimulates multiple signal transduction pathways. The persistent increase of PKMζ protein through the upregulation of PKMζ mRNA translation in LTP requires many of these transient, early signaling events, including NMDAR, CaMKII, ERK, PKA, and mTOR activation, BDNF signaling, and actin filament formation** [Molecular Brain 2018](https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-018-0420-5).

### Activity-Dependent CaMKII Translocation

**Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is an important decoder of Ca²⁺ signals and mediator of synaptic plasticity. In addition to its known accumulation at spines, dynamic recruitment of CaMKII to dendritic subdomains adjacent to activated synapses has been observed in cultured hippocampal neurons** [JCB 2012](https://rupress.org/jcb/article/198/6/1055/36963/Translocation-of-CaMKII-to-dendritic-microtubules).

This process was accompanied by the adjacent remodeling of spines and synaptic AMPA receptor insertion. Replacement of endogenous CaMKII with a mutant that cannot translocate within dendrites lessened this activity-dependent synaptic plasticity [JCB 2012](https://rupress.org/jcb/article/198/6/1055/36963/Translocation-of-CaMKII-to-dendritic-microtubules). Thus, CaMKII could decode compartmental dendritic Ca²⁺ transients to support remodeling of local synapses [JCB 2012](https://rupress.org/jcb/article/198/6/1055/36963/Translocation-of-CaMKII-to-dendritic-microtubules).

## Part X: Ribosomopathies and Epilepsy

### RPL10 Mutations: X-Linked Ribosomopathy with Epilepsy

**Mutations in the ribosomal protein gene RPL10 (uL16) were first discovered to be associated with autism. More recently, mutations in RPL10 (K78E) have been shown to cause X-linked microcephaly, intellectual disability, and seizures** [Genetics 2014](http://www.genetics.org/content/198/2/723.abstract).

Research has documented a multigenerational pedigree with an X-linked syndromic disorder hallmarked by microcephaly, growth retardation, and seizures [ScienceDirect Ribosomopathy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1769721217306961). Using next-generation sequencing, a novel missense mutation in RPL10 was identified, with the p.K78E change segregating with disease under an X-linked recessive paradigm [ScienceDirect Ribosomopathy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1769721217306961).

**The p.K78E substitution appears to be associated with severe microcephaly, seizures, hearing loss, growth retardation, cardiac defects, and dysmorphic facial features** [Genetics 2014](http://www.genetics.org/content/198/2/723.abstract).

### RPS23 and Translational Accuracy

**Ribosomal protein gene mutations, mostly associated with inherited or acquired bone marrow failure, are believed to drive disease by slowing the rate of protein synthesis. De novo missense mutations in the RPS23 gene, which codes for uS12, have been reported in individuals with microcephaly** [PubMed 28257692](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28257692/).

**These uS12 variants impaired the accuracy of mRNA translation and rendered cells highly sensitive to oxidative stress** [PubMed 28257692](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28257692/). These discoveries describe a ribosomopathy linked to uS12 and reveal mechanistic distinctions between RP gene mutations driving hematopoietic disease and those resulting in developmental disorders [PubMed 28257692](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28257692/).

### EEF1A2: Translation Elongation Factor and Epilepsy

**Heterozygous de novo mutations in EEF1A2, encoding the tissue-specific translation elongation factor eEF1A2, have been shown to cause neurodevelopmental disorders including often severe epilepsy and intellectual disability** [PMC 4947865](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4947865/).

While mutations affecting such a basic housekeeping function would at first glance seem unlikely to affect only neurodevelopment, **the specificity of the disorder is determined by the expression pattern of eEF1A isoforms. All vertebrates have two independently encoded isoforms of eEF1A; eEF1A1 is ubiquitously expressed throughout development but is then switched off specifically in neurons and muscle postnatally, where it is replaced by eEF1A2** [PubMed 30370994](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30370994/).

**In humans, there is evidence linking de novo dominant EEF1A2 mutations to extensive neurological deficits, including intractable epilepsy, global developmental delay, severe intellectual disability, hypotonia, and autistic behavior** [Nature Sci Reports 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep46019). Children with mutations in this gene have developmental delay, epilepsy, intellectual disability and often autism; the most frequently occurring mutation is G70S [EEF1A2 GeneCards](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=EEF1A2).

### Genotype-Phenotype Correlations in EEF1A2

**Missense mutations with severe molecular alteration in the t-RNA binding sites or GTP hydrolysis domain were associated with early-onset severe epilepsy, indicating that the clinical expression was potentially determined by the location of mutations and alteration of molecular effects** [ScienceDirect EEF1A2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1525505019312296).

Recent research has shown a broader phenotypic range than previously appreciated: 83% of the patients are walking (vs. 29% in the literature), and 84% of the patients have language skills (vs. 15%) [Nature EJHG 2024](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41431-024-01560-8). Three of the patients do not have ID [Nature EJHG 2024](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41431-024-01560-8). Epilepsy is present in 63% (vs. 93%) [Nature EJHG 2024](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41431-024-01560-8).

### Mechanisms of Neurodevelopmental Pathology in Ribosomopathies

**Recent literature argues for a role of dysregulated ribosomal biogenesis in pathogenesis of various neurodevelopmental syndromes. This dysregulation may lead to cellular pathologies including insufficient proliferation and/or loss of neuroprogenitor cells, apoptosis of immature neurons, altered neuronal morphogenesis, and neurodegeneration** [PMC 6347560](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6347560/).

**The spectrum of neurodevelopmental disruption phenotypes includes brain malformations such as microcephaly, psychiatric disorders including intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorders, or schizophrenia, and various forms of epilepsy** [PMC 6347560](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6347560/).

**Research in Drosophila models has shown that the cellular stress in ribosomopathies is not caused by insufficient protein synthesis, as might be expected. Instead, ribosomal protein deficiency elicits proteotoxic stress, caused by the accumulation of misfolded proteins that overwhelm the protein degradation machinery** [Nature Cell Bio 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-020-00626-1).

## Part XI: Critical Period Plasticity and Synaptogenesis

### The Critical Period: Heightened Plasticity and Vulnerability

**Critical periods are postnatal, restricted time windows of heightened plasticity in cortical neural networks, during which experience refines principal neuron wiring configurations** [Frontiers Cell Neuro 2023](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cellular-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fncel.2023.1247335/full).

**The time window at the beginning of life in which external input signals are connected sensitively and strongly to neural circuit optimization is called the critical period** [PNAS 2020](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1820836117).

**In both the visual cortex and respiratory system regions, the critical period is a time of heightened inhibition, reduced expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and synaptic imbalance with heightened inhibition and suppressed excitation** [Royal Society B 2021](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2021.1025). **Synaptic imbalance renders developing neurons more vulnerable to external stressors** [Royal Society B 2021](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2021.1025). However, the critical period is necessary to enable each system to strengthen its circuitry, adapt to its environment, and transition from immaturity to maturity, when a state of relative synaptic balance is attained [Royal Society B 2021](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2021.1025). Failure to achieve such a balance leads to neurological disorders [Royal Society B 2021](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2021.1025).

### Silent Synapses and Critical Period Plasticity

**During this critical period, changes in motor neuron activity shaped the numbers and distribution of excitatory and inhibitory inputs onto motor dendrites in a homeostatic manner. The motor critical period is terminated by astrocyte maturation, and astrocyte-specific ablation delayed the closure of the motor critical period** [Frontiers Cell Neuro 2023](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cellular-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fncel.2023.1247335/full).

**Nascent gestalt synapses are constantly formed as AMPA receptor-silent synapses which are the substrates for critical period plasticity. Experience drives the unsilencing and stabilization of gestalt synapses, as well as synapse pruning** [PMC 7380267](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7380267/). This maturation process changes synapse patterning and consequently the functional architecture of cortical excitatory networks [PMC 7380267](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7380267/).

### Protein Synthesis Requirements During Critical Periods

**BDNF's normal role includes stimulating energy metabolism by increasing glucose use/transport and enhancing protein synthesis** [PMC 2553093](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2553093/). PKA can rapidly modulate synaptic efficacy and initiate protein synthesis-dependent growth processes [PMC 2553093](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2553093/).

**Rapid ocular dominance plasticity requires cortical but not geniculate protein synthesis**, demonstrating the necessity of local translation during critical period plasticity [PMC 2553093](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2553093/).

### Perineuronal Nets and Critical Period Closure

With age, PV cells are gradually enwrapped by perineuronal nets (PNNs), which both envelop synaptic boutons and create microenvironments in the extracellular milieu for factors such as Otx2 [PNAS 2020](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1820836117). **Removal of PNNs or Otx2 in adulthood resets PV cells to a juvenile state, transiently enabling critical period plasticity anew** [PNAS 2020](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1820836117). Consequently, the brain may toggle between a plastic or nonplastic state to varying degree as a function of PNN/PV cell integrity across the life span [PNAS 2020](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1820836117).

### iPSC Cortical Neuron Maturation Timeline (D35-D65)

**Key markers used to assess synaptogenesis include:** The expression of the presynaptic vesicle marker synapsin I increased during development. Synapsin I was diffused in axons and around cell bodies in early cultures, then aggregated along the mature dendrites in late cultures at day 71, suggesting its concentration at synaptic sites with the progress of neuronal development through synaptogenesis [PMC 8758945](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8758945/).

**Temporal Expression Patterns:** Genes immediately upregulated at day 10 (group UP1) were typically related to axogenesis, neuronal projection, and the formation and trafficking of presynaptic vesicles [PMC 10073939](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10073939/). In contrast, genes upregulated after day 32 (group UP2) were involved in the regulation of transmembrane ion transport and mature synaptic functions including learning or memory, cognition, synaptic plasticity, and long-term potentiation [PMC 10073939](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10073939/).

**D35 Timepoint Markers:** Transient inhibition of EZH2, EHMT1/2 and DOT1L in NPCs induced increased NEFH and STX1A expression in d35 neurons [Nature 2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06984-8). This indicates that at D35, mature neuron markers like neurofilament heavy chain (NEFH) and syntaxin-1A (STX1A) are being expressed [Nature 2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06984-8).

**D65 Timepoint Markers:** Neurons derived from both human embryonic stem cells and iPSCs upon treatment with the EZH2 inhibitor at NPC stage showed increased densities of the presynaptic, postsynaptic and juxtaposed synaptic markers SYN1 and PSD95 at d65 [PMC 10073939](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10073939/).

## Part XII: Excitatory-Inhibitory Balance and Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Epilepsy

### E/I Imbalance as a Core Mechanism

**Normal E/I balance is often shifted in epilepsy, resulting in neuronal network hyperexcitability and recurrent seizures** [Wiley Epilepsia 2023](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/epi.17651). **Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders. Although many factors contribute to epileptogenesis, seizure generation is mostly linked to hyperexcitability due to alterations in excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance** [PMC 8303198](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8303198/).

**Epileptic seizures involve a cortical excitation–inhibition imbalance driven by dysfunctional interneurons that contribute to gamma oscillation generation** [NCBI Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK2510/).

### Role of Interneuron Dysfunction

**One theory proposes that a selective loss of interneurons decreases the normal feed-forward and feedback inhibition of the dentate granule cells, an important group of principal neurons** [NCBI Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK2510/). **The death or dysfunction of GABAergic interneurons in epileptogenic regions of the brain intensifies local disinhibition and facilitates the spread of seizure activity** [PMC 6406372](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6406372/).

Mutation of the gene for the transcription factor Aristaless-related homeobox protein (ARX), leads to impaired inhibitory interneuron migration from the forebrain ganglionic eminences to the neocortex, resulting in hyperexcitability and propensity to seizures such as infantile spasms [PMC 6406372](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6406372/). In this case, the E/I balance is upended by diminished inhibitory neuron intercalation into the neocortical circuit [PMC 6406372](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6406372/).

### Mitochondrial Dysfunction Mechanisms in Epilepsy

**Mitochondrial diseases are a heterogeneous group of diseases resulting from energy deficit and reduced adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production due to impaired oxidative phosphorylation. The manifestation of mitochondrial disease is usually multi-organ. Epilepsy is one of the most common manifestations of diseases resulting from mitochondrial dysfunction, especially in children** [PMC 8303198](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8303198/).

**ATP deficit suppresses the effect of intermediate inhibitory neurons in the hippocampus, facilitating the spread of excitation in the neuronal network. Lack of ATP molecules also results in the reduced potential of GABA-ergic inhibitory neurons, which leads to an impaired balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurons and excessive cell excitation** [PMC 8303198](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8303198/).

**High concentrations of ROS can oxidize mitochondrial proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, cause cell dysfunction, damage the ability of cells to maintain energy levels, cause energy exhaustion, damage and death of neurons, and change the excitability of neurons, thus reducing the threshold of seizures** [PMC 8303198](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8303198/). The imbalance of calcium homeostasis caused by mitochondrial dysfunction can increase the excitability of neurons and induce seizures [PMC 8303198](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8303198/).

### Excitotoxicity and Mitochondrial Feedback

**Excitotoxicity also affects the mitochondria function, since excessive glutamate disrupts Ca+2 balance and ATP production and further leads to the formation of reactive oxygen species** [OAText Excitotoxicity](https://www.oatext.com/excitotoxicity-as-a-molecular-mechanism-in-epilepsy.php).

**The elevated glutamate levels or mutations in metabolic receptors (e.g., AMPA, NMDA) can prolong the activation time of glutamatergic receptors, increase excitatory postsynaptic potential, lead to excitotoxicity, and trigger downstream apoptotic cascades** [Frontiers Epilepsy](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neurology/articles/10.3389/fneur.2024.1499876/full). Excessive activation of NMDA and AMPA receptors can cause a sharp influx of sodium and calcium ions. Excessive calcium influx leads to calcium overload in the mitochondrial matrix, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction [Frontiers Epilepsy](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neurology/articles/10.3389/fneur.2024.1499876/full).

### Neuroinflammation and Oxidative Stress

**Metabolic dysfunction, excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) imbalance, and neurodegeneration can all result from these oxidative and inflammatory processes which ultimately contribute to epileptogenesis** [Frontiers Cell Dev Bio 2022](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cell-and-developmental-biology/articles/10.3389/fcell.2022.976953/full). NF-KB activation leads to the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, TNFα, and IL-6, which have been shown to induce gliosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and glutathione (GSH) depletion [Frontiers Cell Dev Bio 2022](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cell-and-developmental-biology/articles/10.3389/fcell.2022.976953/full).

## Part XIII: Integrated Mechanistic Model

### The Energy-Translation Crisis Cascade

Based on the comprehensive literature review, the following mechanistic cascade emerges:

**1. Primary Defect: DRP1 Mutations → Mitochondrial Hyperfusion**
- G32A and R403C dominant-negative mutations stall fission events
- Mitochondria become hyperfused with aberrant cristae structure
- Mitochondrial membrane potential becomes hyperpolarized
- Coupling efficiency decreases, with increased proton leak

**2. Mitochondrial Mispositioning → Local Synaptic ATP Depletion**
- Hyperfused mitochondria fail to traffic properly to synaptic terminals
- Stationary mitochondria cannot be maintained at pre- and postsynaptic sites
- ATP diffusion is limited in neuronal processes (~10-20 μm compartments)
- Result: Spatially confined ATP depletion at synapses despite adequate global ATP

**3. Mitochondrial Compensation Response (Upregulation)**
- Cells detect impaired OXPHOS coupling efficiency
- Upregulate 4 core pathways: mitochondrial ribosome, mitoribosome assembly, mtDNA maintenance, OXPHOS
- Attempt to increase mitochondrial translation capacity
- Glycolysis upregulation as metabolic adaptation

**4. Paradoxical Ribosome Downregulation**
- Local ATP deficit at synapses cannot support translation (4 ATP per peptide bond)
- Ribosome Assembly Stress Response (RASTR) activated
- Cytoplasmic ribosome biogenesis continues but ribosomes cannot function
- SynGO presynaptic and postsynaptic ribosome pathways specifically downregulated
- Translation initiation and elongation factors impaired

**5. Failed Local Protein Synthesis During Critical Period (D35-D65)**
- 75% of presynaptic terminals normally contain active ribosomes
- 60% of dendritic spines normally show active translation
- In DRP1 mutants: insufficient synthesis of synaptic proteins including:
  * Presynaptic: Synaptic vesicle proteins, neurotransmitter synthesis enzymes (GAD65/67)
  * Postsynaptic: AMPA receptors, NMDA receptors, GABA-A receptors, PSD scaffolds
- Result: Failed synapse maturation and reduced synaptic colocalization

**6. Calcium Dysregulation Amplifies the Crisis**
- NNAT upregulation (most significant DEG at D35) → ER calcium overload via SERCA2 inhibition
- CACNG3 downregulation (>2-fold at D65) → loss of AMPA receptor modulation
- STIM/ORAI dysregulation → aberrant store-operated calcium entry
- Disrupted MAM function → impaired ER-mitochondria calcium transfer
- Result: Higher calcium amplitude, faster time-to-peak, slower clearance

**7. Excitatory-Inhibitory Imbalance**
- Insufficient GABA-A receptor synthesis at inhibitory synapses
- Reduced GAD65/67 synthesis → decreased GABA production
- ATP deficit suppresses inhibitory interneuron function
- Enhanced AMPA receptor activity (loss of CACNG3 inhibition)
- Calcium dysregulation increases neuronal excitability
- Result: Network hyperexcitability

**8. Clinical Manifestation: Epileptic Encephalopathy**
- Refractory seizures and status epilepticus
- Developmental delay and regression
- Failed critical period plasticity
- Progressive neurodegeneration from chronic excitotoxicity

## Key Unanswered Questions for Future Research

1. **Transcriptional Regulation of Ribosome Downregulation**
   - What transcription factors mediate the specific downregulation of synaptic ribosome pathways?
   - Is this mediated through MYC, mTOR, or novel stress-response pathways?
   - Role of ATF4 and integrated stress response in this context?

2. **Spatial Specificity of ATP Depletion**
   - How precisely localized is the ATP deficit (~10-20 μm compartments)?
   - Can this be measured directly in DRP1 mutant neurons using genetically encoded ATP sensors?
   - Does ATP depletion occur equally at pre- and postsynaptic compartments?

3. **Ribosome Paradox Resolution**
   - Why does ribosome biogenesis remain upregulated if translation is failing?
   - Is this a failure of feedback signaling or a stress-response override?
   - Do unassembled ribosomal proteins accumulate and trigger proteotoxic stress?

4. **Therapeutic Window**
   - Can early intervention (before D65) rescue synaptic maturation?
   - Would enhancing mitochondrial fission pharmacologically prevent the phenotype?
   - Can energy supplementation or translation enhancement strategies work?

5. **Mutation-Specific Effects**
   - Why does R403C show broader compensation (100 vs 74 pathways) than G32A?
   - Do GTPase domain (G32A) vs stalk domain (R403C) mutations differentially affect mitochondrial trafficking vs fission?
   - Are there mutation-specific therapeutic vulnerabilities?

## Critical Gaps in Current Literature

1. **Direct measurements of local ATP at synapses in DRP1 mutant neurons** - While spatial ATP compartmentalization has been demonstrated (2025 bioRxiv), this has not been measured in DRP1 mutation context.

2. **Time-course of ribosome downregulation vs calcium dysregulation** - The temporal relationship between NNAT upregulation (D35) and ribosome pathway downregulation (D35→D65) needs elucidation.

3. **Cell-type specific effects** - Do inhibitory interneurons show greater vulnerability due to higher energy demands for GABA synthesis?

4. **MAM integrity in DRP1 mutants** - Direct measurement of ER-mitochondria contact sites and calcium transfer efficiency.

5. **Reversibility studies** - Can the synaptic phenotype be rescued by restoring mitochondrial positioning or enhancing local ATP production after D65?

## Conclusion

The literature comprehensively supports a model where **DRP1 mutations create a spatial energy-translation crisis at synapses during the critical developmental window**. The paradoxical upregulation of mitochondrial ribosome pathways alongside downregulation of cytoplasmic synaptic ribosomes represents a failed compensatory response: cells attempt to increase mitochondrial OXPHOS capacity, but hyperfused mitochondria cannot reach synaptic sites to deliver ATP. Without sufficient local ATP (4 ATP/peptide bond), synaptic ribosomes cannot function, local protein synthesis fails, synapses do not mature properly, and excitatory-inhibitory imbalance emerges, manifesting as epileptic encephalopathy. This mechanism connects mitochondrial dynamics, energy metabolism, protein synthesis, and synaptic function in a developmentally-specific pathological cascade.
