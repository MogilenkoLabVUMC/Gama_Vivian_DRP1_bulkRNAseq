## Overview

This directory contains focused analysis of ATP synthase (Complex V of the electron transport chain) gene expression and pathway enrichment. Complex V is of particular interest because:

1. DRP1 mutations affect mitochondrial dynamics and ATP production
2. ATP depletion may explain the translation crisis phenotype
3. Complex V represents the final step of oxidative phosphorylation

## Biological Background

### Complex V (ATP Synthase)

ATP synthase uses the proton gradient generated by Complexes I-IV to synthesize ATP:

```
              H⁺ gradient (from ETC)
                      ↓
    ADP + Pi ──[Complex V]──→ ATP
                      ↓
            Powers cellular processes
```

### Complex V Subunits

ATP synthase consists of two main sectors:

**F₀ sector (membrane-embedded):**
- ATP5PB, ATP5MC1, ATP5MC2, ATP5MC3
- ATP5ME, ATP5MF, ATP5MG
- ATP5PD, ATP5PF

**F₁ sector (matrix-facing):**
- ATP5F1A (α), ATP5F1B (β)
- ATP5F1C (γ), ATP5F1D (δ)
- ATP5F1E (ε)

| R403C | Reduced | ↑ (compensated) | Partial rescue |

### Pathway Enrichment Summary

| Contrast | Direction | Interpretation |
|----------|-----------|----------------|
| G32A_vs_Ctrl_D35 | Downregulated | Early ATP synthesis deficit |
| R403C_vs_Ctrl_D35 | Downregulated | Early ATP synthesis deficit |
| Time_Ctrl | Upregulated | Normal maturation |
| Time_G32A | Variable | Impaired maturation |
| Time_R403C | Upregulated | Compensatory increase |

## Connection to Translation Crisis

The translation crisis hypothesis:

```
DRP1 mutation
      ↓
Mitochondrial dysfunction
      ↓
Reduced ATP production (Complex V deficit)
      ↓
ATP depletion at synapses
      ↓
Cannot power translation (ATP-dependent)
      ↓
Synaptic protein synthesis failure
      ↓
Failed neuronal maturation
```

Complex V analysis provides direct evidence for the ATP production step.

# Define Complex V genes
complex_v_genes <- c(

)

# Load expression data
qc_vars <- readRDS("checkpoints/qc_variables.rds")
expr <- qc_vars$logCPM

# Filter to Complex V genes
complex_v_expr <- expr[rownames(expr) %in% complex_v_genes, ]

# Create heatmap
pheatmap(complex_v_expr,
         scale = "row",
         cluster_cols = FALSE,
