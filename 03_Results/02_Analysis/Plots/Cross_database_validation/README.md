# Cross-Database Validation Plots

## Purpose

This folder contains cross-database GSEA validation analysis that classifies pathway enrichment patterns across the developmental trajectory (D35 → D65) for both DRP1 mutations (G32A and R403C). The analysis validates findings across 10 independent pathway databases to identify robust, replicated biological signals versus database-specific artifacts.

## Generating Script

- **Script**: `02_Analysis/8.pattern_summary_normalized.py`
- **Runtime**: ~2-5 minutes
- **Dependencies**:
  - `03_Results/02_Analysis/Python_exports/gsea_trajectory.csv` (generated by `3.export_gsea_for_python.R`)
  - GSEA results from main pipeline checkpoints

## Pattern Classification Framework

Pathways are classified into temporal patterns based on their enrichment across three developmental stages:

| Pattern | Definition | Biological Interpretation |
|---------|------------|--------------------------|
| **Compensation** | Early disruption (D35) followed by recovery (D65) | Adaptive response; system compensates for mutation effects |
| **Progressive** | Gradual worsening from D35 to D65 | Cumulative damage; deficits worsen with maturation |
| **Transient** | Disruption only at D35, resolved by D65 | Transient developmental delay |
| **Late_onset** | Normal at D35, disrupted at D65 | Maturation-dependent dysfunction |
| **Natural_improvement** | D35 and D65 both improved | Enhanced pathway activity at both timepoints |
| **Natural_worsening** | D35 and D65 both disrupted | Persistent pathway dysfunction |
| **Complex** | Inconsistent patterns across comparisons | Mixed or non-linear effects |

## Methods

**GSEA Parameters**:
- **Software**: fgsea (R package)
- **Gene ranking**: t-statistic from limma-voom differential expression
- **Thresholds**: FDR < 0.05 for significance
- **Permutations**: 10,000
- **Min/max gene set size**: 15-500 genes

**Pattern Classification Algorithm**:
1. Extract NES and FDR for each pathway across Early, TrajDev, and Late contrasts
2. Determine directionality (UP/DOWN/NS) for each stage based on NES sign and FDR < 0.05
3. Apply decision tree:
   - Early DOWN + Late DOWN + TrajDev UP → **Compensation**
   - Early DOWN + Late DOWN → **Progressive**
   - Early DOWN + Late NS → **Transient**
   - Early NS + Late DOWN → **Late_onset**
   - Early UP + Late UP → **Natural_improvement**
   - Early DOWN + Late DOWN (both stages affected) → **Natural_worsening**
   - Inconsistent patterns → **Complex**

**Statistical Testing**:
- Individual pathway significance: FDR-corrected p-values from GSEA
- Sample size: N=3 biological replicates per group
- Differential expression: limma-voom with TMM normalization

## Key Findings

### Cross-Database Validation

1. **Compensation is widespread**: All databases show substantial compensation pathways
   - G32A: 45 MitoCarta, 36 Hallmark, 824 Reactome
   - R403C: 29 MitoCarta, 42 Hallmark, 893 Reactome

2. **Mitochondrial pathways robustly compensate**: MitoCarta shows strongest compensation signal
   - 45/72 significant pathways (62%) show compensation in G32A
   - Includes: OXPHOS, ribosome assembly, mtDNA maintenance

3. **Natural worsening more common in R403C**:
   - MitoCarta: 26 pathways (R403C) vs 14 (G32A)
   - Suggests R403C has broader, more persistent mitochondrial dysfunction

4. **Synaptic pathways show mixed patterns**: SynGO analysis reveals
   - Both mutations: ~20 compensation pathways (pre/postsynaptic compartments)
   - Progressive pathways minimal (2 each)
   - Transient effects rare

5. **GO:BP captures most pathways**: 3111 (G32A) and 3267 (R403C) compensation pathways
   - Reflects broader biological process coverage
   - Validates findings from more specific databases

### Biological Interpretation

The cross-database consistency supports three major conclusions:

1. **Adaptive compensation is the primary response** to DRP1 mutations during neuronal maturation
2. **Mitochondrial pathways are central** to both mutation and compensation mechanisms
3. **G32A shows stronger compensation** while **R403C shows more persistent dysfunction**, suggesting domain-specific effects (GTPase vs stalk domain)

## Interpretation Guide

### Reading Trajectory Comparative Plots

1. **Look for consistent patterns**: Pathways with similar color patterns across Early → TrajDev → Late indicate robust temporal trends
2. **Compare mutations**: Pathways with different patterns between G32A and R403C panels indicate mutation-specific effects
3. **Focus on pattern labels**: Quickly identify whether pathways compensate, worsen, or show complex dynamics
4. **Color intensity**: Darker colors (red/blue) indicate stronger enrichment effects

### Pattern Summary Bar Plot

- **High compensation bars**: Indicate successful adaptive responses
- **High progressive/natural_worsening bars**: Indicate failure to compensate
- **Database consistency**: Similar patterns across databases validate findings
- **Mutation differences**: Different bar heights reveal mutation-specific trajectory profiles

## Notes

- Pattern classifications are deterministic based on NES direction and FDR thresholds
- Some pathways may be unclassifiable if they show inconsistent or contradictory enrichment patterns
- Database-specific pathway definitions can lead to different classifications for overlapping gene sets
- MitoCarta and SynGO are custom databases specifically curated for this analysis domain
